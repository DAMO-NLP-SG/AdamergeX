The term can also refer to groups or teams that work together asynchronously or across organizational levels. Powell, Piccoli and Ives (2004) define virtual teams as \"groups of geographically, organizationally and/or time dispersed workers brought together by information and telecommunication technologies to accomplish one or more organizational tasks.\" As documented by Gibson (2020), virtual teams grew in importance and number during 2000-2020, particularly in light of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic which forced many workers to collaborate remotely with each other as they worked from home. As the proliferation of fiber optic technology has significantly increased the scope of off-site communication, there has been a tremendous increase in both the use of virtual teams and scholarly attention devoted to understanding how to make virtual teams more effective (see Stanko & Gibson, 2009; Hertel, Geister & Konradt, 2005; and Martins, Gilson & Maaynard, 2004 for reviews). When utilized successfully, virtual teams allow companies to procure the best expertise without geographical restrictions, to integrate information, knowledge, and resources from a broad variety of contexts within the same team, and to acquire and apply knowledge to critical tasks in global firms. According to Hambley, O'Neil, & Kline (2007), \"virtual teams require new ways of working across boundaries through systems, processes, technology, and people, which requires effective leadership.\" Such work often involves learning processes such as integrating and sharing different location-specific knowledge and practices, which must work in concert for the multi-unit firm to be aligned. Yet, teams with a high degree of “virtuality” are not without their challenges, and when managed poorly, they often underperform face-to-face (FTF) teams. In light of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, many industries experienced a rapid and overnight transition to virtual work as a result of “social distancing.” However, some scholars have argued the phrase “social distancing” in reference to",

Today, most work teams have become virtual to some degree, though the literature has yet to incorporate the dynamic urgency of the pandemic and the impacts of rapid-fire learning of new technology and communication skills. Origins The acceleration of digital technologies has allowed common, even synchronous activities to be distributed across employees at remote locations. These decentralized work arrangements were first named telework in the 1970s, defined as “work carried out in a location remote from the central offices or production facilities, where the worker has no personal contact with coworkers but is able to communicate with them electronically”. Typically, the remote location is the home, though telework centers and remote offices are alternative locations. Since the introduction of home computers in the 1980s and laptops and mobile phones in the 1990s, increasing numbers of office workers have become able to work from different locations. Moreover, the shift from manufacturing to an information economy has expanded the number of jobs amenable to remote work. Telecommuting is referred to as telework, remote work, distributed work, virtual work, flexible work, flexplace, and distance work, among other labels. Investigations of such flexible work locations began in earnest over 30 years ago (see Ramsower, 1983). Distributed work and telecommuting have become widespread practices, growing steadily in the United States and abroad. A 2002 study by the Gartner Group indicated that more than 60% of professional American employees worked in teams characterized by virtuality, and by 2012, nearly 3.3 million American workers telecommuted for at least half of the time. Globally, an international survey of 254 senior-level executives revealed that staff in two thirds of their global firms were involved in distributed work. Early research heralded virtual teams as a promising design for integrating firms and taking maximum advantage of innovation-creating capabilities. They were likewise touted as means to permit flexibility in the “where” of tasks, to allow workers to meet household needs, and to enable organizations to adapt work arrangements to changing environments and labor needs. According to Gibson and Gibbs (2006: 453), the term “virtual” represents a wide variety of teams that are at least to some extent geographically dispersed (consisting of members spread across more than one location), mediated by technology (communicating using electronic tools such as e-mail or instant messaging), structurally dynamic (in which change occurs frequently among members, their roles, and relationships to each other), or nationally diverse (consisting of members with more than one national background). Much of the literature has focused on the challenges of virtual teams, while few have identified their assets and benefits, identifying strategies by which to increase team effectiveness and satisfaction. As technological ability and industry contexts are rapidly and continuously changing, virtual work represents a promising avenue of research as an ever-evolving, fundamental shift in how organizations have historically done business.

    {
        "prompt": "virtual team – geographic dispersion, electronic dependence, national diversity, and dynamic structure – have unique effects and should be considered independently. For example, although electronic dependence sometimes coincides with geographic dispersion, this is not always the case; teams in the same office may use e-mail to avoid the trip up to another floor, and teams in different countries may prefer to meet face-to-face infrequently rather than use video calls. As such, there is conceptual agreement that virtuality is a multidimensional higher-order construct. Rather than being dichotomous “on-off” conditions, these four features of virtuality each represent a continuum, and the degree of difference influences the strength of its effects. These four factors will be explored in further detail below. Geographic dispersion refers to the degree of physical distance between team colleagues. A team that spans multiple continents is more dispersed than one whose participants are located in the same city, and this degree of dispersion in turn modulates the severity of outcomes. Electronic dependence refers to the degree of reliance on electronic tools such as e-mail or instant messaging for communications. National diversity refers to the number of different nationalities represented on the team. Virtual teams may consist of members of a single nationality (e.g. a software team split between the American East and West Coasts, but who all share American nationality or a global team of Germans who work in different countries, but all share German nationality). Colleagues from different nations may bring different cultural values, mindsets, allegiances, and communication styles to the team. Dynamic structure/membership refers to how often members leave and join the team, and to how stable or changeable members’ roles are. Rather than having stable membership, many virtual teams are short-term and project-based, or involve frequent member turnover. Framework for Processes Overview According to Gibson and Cohen (2003), the effectiveness of virtual teams is a function of enabling conditions, which are created and supported by managers and leaders, and do not work independently but rather in concert with one another through multiple performance strategies. Multiple design and implementation factors help to create the conditions that support virtual team effectiveness. These factors include organizational context, team design, technology use, team member characteristics, and work and team processes. Virtuality amplifies the challenges faced by teams. As teams become more virtual, they confront greater uncertainty and complexity, increasing the difficulty of the information processing and sensemaking tasks they face. Likewise, the greater the number and depth of differences that need to be managed in virtual teams, the greater the barriers to effectiveness. These teams must be designed, supported, and led effectively to be successful. When they are well supported, virtual teams enable the best talent irrespective of location, capitalize on each organization’s unique competencies, and bring together people from different perspectives and knowledge bases, leading to higher levels of innovation. This orienting framework is explained in more detail below. Enabling Conditions For virtual teams to perform well, three enabling conditions must be established: (1) shared understanding about the team’s goals, tasks, work processes, and member characteristics; (2) integration or coordination",
        "completion": "across"
    },
    {
        "prompt": "key organizational systems and structures; and (3) mutual trust in the team. Shared understanding is the degree of cognitive overlap and commonality in beliefs, expectations, and perceptions about a given target. Virtual teams need to develop a shared understanding about their goals, their tasks, how to achieve them, and what each team member brings to the team. Integration is the process of establishing ways in which the parts can work together to create value, develop products, or deliver services. The parts of the organization represented by virtual team members are likely to be highly differentiated in response to global competitive pressures and uncertain business environments, potentially hindering effective collaboration. Notably, the lower the level of integration, the greater the difficulty of developing shared understanding. Mutual or collective trust is a shared psychological state that is characterized by an acceptance of vulnerability based on expectations of intentions or behaviors of others within the team. As members are geographically dispersed and often from different backgrounds, experiences, and cultures, trust is difficult to establish in virtual teams. Thus, it is how the team is designed and managed that creates enabling conditions. Design Factors There are a number of structures and systems which critically enable virtual team success. Design of a virtual team involves structuring the interactions; what kind of communication tools are used; how much face-to-face time will be possible, etc. These design factors fall into five categories: context, group structure, technology, people, and process. First, those structures that comprise the organizational context include education and training, rewards, reviews such as performance evaluation systems, and selection. Second, the virtual team’s structure works to promote task accomplishment through goals, leadership, task design, and social structures. Third, information technology provides the infrastructure for virtual collaboration by allowing teams to communicate and coordinate their work. The challenge here is determining which technologies are appropriate for what tasks and when. Fourth, the people who work in virtual teams should possess certain capabilities to work effectively with others, such as sufficient task related knowledge and skills. Further, team members need to have a tolerance for ambiguity to deal with the unstructured communication that characterizes virtual teamwork. Finally, one’s team and work processes can help or hinder the creation of enabling conditions. This includes the creation of effectives means of communication, decision making, and conflict resolution by leaders and managers. Virtuality and Degree of Differences As explored above, Gibson & Cohen (2003) indicated that the relationship between design factors and enabling conditions is moderated by the degree of virtuality and degree of differences. It follows that the greater the degree of virtuality and degree of differences, the more difficult it will be to establish supportive enabling conditions. The degree of virtuality includes the degree of electronic dependency and geographical dispersion, while the degree of differences includes the degree of variation in culture, language, organization, and function. Outputs The outputs of virtual work include all the things that result from the team’s work processes. These can be organized into two categories: business outcomes and human outcomes. Possible business outcomes are goal",

    {
        "prompt": "productivity, timeliness, customer satisfaction, organization learning, innovation, and cycle time. Possible human outcomes include team member attitudes such as commitment, satisfaction, and longevity, i.e., the capacity to work together in the future. Often, these judgments of performance are subjective and depend on the team’s manager or other stakeholders in its social system. Studies have found that effectiveness can increase the greater the virtuality of a team, but only when many of the features in the framework are in place. For example, teams which fostered a shared identity by communicating consistently, developing relationships, and openly acknowledging cultural differences were better able to harness the energy and commitment of members. Such strong team identity may help to allow for constructive controversy which enables the open sharing of views, knowledge and perspective coinciding with members’ identities. As Gibson and co-authors (2020) found, teams with high resilience, tolerance for ambiguity, and strong team identification experienced less intrapersonal identity conflict and therefore thrived more at work. Likewise, formalization processes that help to establish the global team as a source of identity, such as implementing rules and procedures early on and clarifying team boundaries, increase knowledge sharing and thus improve team effectiveness. Gibson and her colleagues (2021) further found that virtual teams were more effective when they were able to recognize cues indicating when existing technologies had become constraints and strategically change their technology affordances to accommodate shifts in knowledge management activities. Teams which used a “dynamic connection repertoire” to co-evolve their purpose and technology were highly successful, as opposed to teams which failed to shift to different technologies as task needs changed. Other studies have compared students working in purely virtual teams to purely face-to-face teams and found mixed results. Tan et al. found that teams which used their dialogue technique were more satisfied with decisions made in the team. One study found that a traditional team started out more satisfied than a virtual team. Then, in less than a year, the satisfaction of the virtual team rose and exceeded the satisfaction of the traditional team. Women were more satisfied than men with virtual teams and were also more satisfied compared to women in face-to-face teams. Team members that were more satisfied were more likely to have had training and used more communication methods compared to unsatisfied team members. Types The most common types of virtual teams include: 1. Networked teams 2. Parallel teams 3. Project development teams 4. Work, production or functional teams 5. Service teams 6. Offshore ISD teams 7. Global Virtual Teams Networked teams Generally, networked teams are geographically distributed and not necessarily from the same organization. These teams are frequently created and just as frequently dissolved; they are usually formed to discuss specific topics where members from the area of expertise, possibly from different organizations, pitch their ideas in the same discussion. Depending on the complexity of the issue, additional members to the team may be added at any time. The duration these teams last may vary significantly depending on how fast or slow the issue is resolved. Parallel teams Parallel teams",

        "prompt": "highly task oriented teams that usually consist of specialized professionals. While they are generally only required for short spans of time, unlike networked teams, they are not dissolved after completion of the tasks. The team may be either internal or external to the organization. Project development teams Similar to parallel teams, these teams are geographically distributed and may operate from different time zones. Project development teams are mainly focused on creating new products, information systems or organizational processes for users and/or customers. These teams exist longer than parallel teams and have the added ability to make decisions rather than just make recommendations. Similar to networked teams, project development teams may also add or remove members of their team at any given time, as needed for their area of expertise. Work, production or functional teams These teams are totally function specific where they only work on a particular area within an organization (i.e. finance, training, research, etc.). Operating virtually from different geographical locations, these teams exist to perform regular or ongoing tasks. Service teams Service teams are geographically located in different time-zones and are assigned to a particular service such as customer support, network upgrades, data maintenance, etc. Each team works on providing the particular service in their daylight hours and at the end of day, work is delegated to the next team which operates in a different time zone so that there is someone handling the service 24 hours a day. Offshore ISD teams Offshore ISD outsourcing teams are independent service provider teams that a company can subcontract portions of work to. These teams usually work in conjunction with an onshore team. Offshore ISD is commonly used for software development as well as international R&D projects. Global virtual teams Global Virtual Teams (GVT) are defined as “a group of workers, formally recognized by the organization as a team, with members from different countries who are collectively accountable for outputs across locations, and who utilize technology to some degree to accomplish their work”. These teams usually span multiple countries and excel at their ability to transfer best practices across sites, resulting in substantial improvements in operations. However, they may struggle with establishing effective communication which engenders trust and engages team members. Management According to Maznevksi and Chudoba (2000), the life circle of virtual team management includes five stages: 1. Preparations 2. Launch 3. Performance management 4. Team development 5. Disbanding Preparations The initial task during the implementation of a team is the definition of the general purpose of the team together with the determination of the level of virtuality that might be appropriate to achieve these goals. Purpose is generally translated into certain action steps for people to on with a defined structure consisting of common goals, individual tasks and results. A number of factors may affect the performance of members of a virtual team. For example, team members with a higher degree of focused attention and aggregate lower levels of temporal dissociation (or flow ) may have higher performance. Further, members with higher degrees of attention focus may prefer asynchronous communication",
        "completion": "channels,"
    },
    {
        "prompt": "while those with low levels of flow may prefer synchronous communication channels. These decisions are usually determined by strategic factors such as mergers, increase of the market span, cost reductions, flexibility and reactivity to the market, etc. Management-related activities taking place during the preparation phase include drafting a mission statement, personnel selection, task design, rewards system design, organizational integration, and choosing appropriate technologies for the tasks at hand. Launch In many cases, at the beginning of virtual teamwork, members make a point to meet each other face-to-face. Crucial elements of such a “kick-off” workshop are getting acquainted with the other team members, clarifying the team goals, clarifying the roles and functions of the team members, information and training how communication technologies can be used efficiently, and developing general rules for the teamwork. As a consequence, “kick-off” workshops are expected to promote clarification of team processes, trust building, building of a shared interpretative context, and high identification with the team. Getting acquainted, goal clarification and development of intra-team rules are also usually accomplished during this phase. Initial field data that compares virtual teams with and without such “kick-off” meetings confirm a general positive impact on team effectiveness, although more differentiated research is necessary. Experimental studies demonstrate that getting acquainted before the start of computer-mediated work facilitates cooperation and trust. Technology Agility As soon as possible after launch, virtual teams must agree upon norms for technology use. Technology is essential to members’ interaction and communication. The electronic dependence integral to virtual work can however create logistical and technological constraints that limit informal spontaneous interacting and informal feedback, hindering knowledge interpretation and making corrective behavior more difficult. Therefore, team members must choose technology carefully, in order to offer the affordances needed at a given point in time, as each technology brings with it a number of affordances as well as constraints for interaction. An affordance is a purpose for use, and technology affordances refer to the mutually supportive relationship between human-endowed purposes to an activity and the technology use. Importantly, the need for certain affordances change over time as teams’ tasks evolve. Gibson and her colleagues (2021) found that teams which were the most successful in progressing across different knowledge management activities used a “dynamic connection repertoire”, which is symbiotic with the nature of the task as it evolves over time. Rather than keeping a static technology repertoire, teams which co-evolved their purpose and technology affordances were better able to sustain effectiveness. A series of psychosocial cues were identified by Gibson and her colleagues, which signal the need to shift to different technologies, because the current technology use is failing to meet the teams’ needs. These cues pertained to how well information was being shared and understood by all team members, and the extent to which members were engaged in the team. Technologies which allow for higher media richness, such as video and screen-sharing, can help reduce inconsistencies in context and make communication more personal and effective.

Leadership is a central challenge in virtual teams, as direct control is difficult when team managers are not at the same location as the team members. As a consequence, delegative management principles are considered that shift parts of classic managerial functions to the team members. However, team members only accept and fulfill such managerial functions when they are motivated and identify with the team and its goals, which is typically more difficult to achieve in virtual teams.Empirical research summarizes three leadership approaches that differ in the degree of team member autonomy: (1) electronic monitoring as an attempt to realize directive leadership over distance, (2) management by objectives (MBO) as an example for delegative leadership principles, and (3) self-managing teams as an example for rather autonomous teamwork. With regard to conflict, predominant research issues have been conflict escalation and disinhibited communication (“flaming”), the fit between communication media and communication contents, and the role of non-job-related communication. One of the important needs for successful conflict resolution is the ability to have every member of the group together repeatedly over time. Effective dispersed groups show spikes in presence during communication over time, while ineffective groups do not have as dramatic spikes. For the management of motivational and emotional processes, three groups of such processes have been addressed in empirical investigations so far: motivation and trust, team identification and cohesion, and satisfaction of the team members. Since most of the variables are originated within the person, they can vary considerably among the members of a team, requiring appropriate aggregation procedures for multilevel analyses (e.g. motivation may be mediated by interpersonal trust). Team Development The success and satisfaction of virtual teams can be supported by personnel and team development interventions. The development of such training concepts should be based on an empirical assessment of the needs and/or deficits of the team and its members, and the effectiveness of the trainings should be evaluated empirically. The steps of team developments include assessment of needs/deficits, individual and team training, and evaluation of training effects. Assessing behaviors of the team members to identify behavioral cues may improve virtual team dynamics and increase team productivity. Behaviors may be assessed through DiSC assessments. Virtual teams have become more pertinent due to Covid-19. For managers, some of the ways to foster virtual team growth and success include monitoring trust levels, focusing on communication improvements, fostering inclusion via emotional safety within a group, and actively discussing teamwork with the group frequently. Disbanding and Re-integration Finally, while some teams remain ongoing and continue with new tasks or members, some virtual teams with shorter time frames go through a phase of disbanding and reintegration, during which members return to in-person offices or join other virtual projects. This disbanding and reintegration of team members is an important issue that has been neglected in both empirical and conceptual work on virtual teams.

        "prompt": "constructive disbanding is crucial in order to maintain high motivation and satisfaction among employees. Members of transient project teams anticipate the end of the teamwork in the foreseeable future, which in turn can overshadow interaction with other team members and shared outcomes. The final stage of group development should be a gradual emotional disengagement that includes both sadness about separation and (in successful groups) joy and pride in the achievements of the team. Strengths of Virtual Teams Team Composition Virtual teams may help to create a more equal workplace, discouraging age, race, and disability discrimination by forcing individuals to interact with others whose differences challenge their assumptions. Physically disadvantaged employees are also able to participate more in teams where communication is virtual, where they may not have previously been able to due to physical limitations of an office or other workspace. Virtual teams also create a more accessible workplace for those who care for children or other family members, or workers who prefer flexible work arrangements for a wide range of reasons. By enabling more flexible and equal working conditions, virtual teams significantly expand the pool of available expertise, thereby allowing firms to acquire the best possible candidates. Moreover, virtual teams’ use of communication technologies also helps to mitigate some problems of cultural diversity. For instance, email as a medium of communication does not transfer accents and carries fewer noticeable verbal language differences than voice communication. Cultural barriers are not removed from the team, but are instead shielded from view in situations where they are irrelevant. In fact, simply understanding team diversity and accommodating it can strengthen the relationship between team members of different cultures. Innovation When managed effectively, virtual teams can be highly effective in promoting innovation, creativity, and participation. For example, in Gibson and Gibbs’ (2006) study of design team innovation, teams were more innovative as virtuality increased when they had a psychologically safe communication climate. Because a company is able to recruit from a larger pool of employees when using virtual teams, a growing amount of talent and distributed expertise is obtainable without the employee traveling often. The use of virtual teams also allows employees to participate in multiple projects within the company that are located on different sites. This in turn helps the company by allowing them to reuse existing resources so that they are not required to hire a new employee to do the same job. Chidambaram and Bostrom (1993) found that virtual teams generate more ideas compared to traditional teams. Part of this effect can be attributed to cultural diversity, which has been shown to positively impact group decision-making. Combined with collaborative conflict management, groups of individuals from different cultural perspectives are more likely to actively participate in group decision making. The differing backgrounds and experiences of these group members also encourage creativity and create conflicting viewpoints, which make it more likely that multiple options are explored and considered. Geographic Reach Multinational organizations often deploy global teams which span various national locations to serve as mechanisms for coordinating core operations across geographical and cultural boundaries.",

Virtual teams further boost firms’ ability to identify and transfer best practices across locations, resulting in a substantial improvement to the operational efficiency of each site while preventing any one site from “re-inventing the wheel”. National Diversity Though national diversity may sometimes lead to conflicts and poor internal communication among team members due to differing ideas of a team and its operation, when managed correctly, virtual teams enable firms to take advantage of diverse and creative viewpoints. Notably, virtual teams are susceptible to intrapersonal identity conflict and struggle to develop a shared team vision due to strong identification with subgroups. Yet, these coordination problems and obstacles to effective communication may be solved by actively understanding and accepting differences in cultures. A multi-country study, based on the GLOBE culture model conducted by Gibson and Gibbs (2006), found that virtual communication environments were experienced differently by people from different cultures. The culture dimension individualism-collectivism was most strongly and very significantly related to how positively or negatively team members experienced videoconferences and telephone conferences, compared to face-to-face meetings. People from collectivistic societies showed a stronger preference for face-to-face meetings and evaluated virtual meetings more negatively compared to people from more individualistic societies. However, Haas (2006) discovered that a mix of locals and cosmopolitans was optimal for global virtual team performance. Research examining product development efforts in over 20 firms has shown that when diverse members of project teams combined their perspectives in a highly iterative way to improve integrated information flow, they were more innovative. This is echoed by Gibbs and Gibson’s 2006 study which established that a psychologically safe communication climate where members feel comfortable asking questions can help bridge national differences, reduce ingroup/outgroup bias, and resolve conflicts, as teams who communicate openly are more likely to develop a common frame of reference and shared mental model. Ultimately, the exchange of diverse perspectives and information among global team members has been found to improve team and organizational performance through the generation of better knowledge sharing and higher quality solutions. Reduction in Relocation and Travel Virtual teams can save travel time and cost, significant expenses for businesses with multiple locations or having virtual clients located in multiple places. They also reduce disruption in the normal workday by not requiring an individual to physically leave their workspace. This improved efficiency can directly translate to saved costs for a company. Strategies to Mitigate Challenges of Virtual Work Despite the improvement in telecommunication to overcome distance as an obstacle for collaboration, working in separate locations still increases the odds that people are not on common ground, and are not aware of it. Common ground, shared mutual knowledge, is an important element to successful communication and coordinated activity. Working separately and communicating through technology makes it more difficult to detect and resolve misunderstandings from a lack of common ground.

One major hurdle in drawing definitive conclusions is that studies of this innovation appear in dispersed literatures including information systems, logistics, industrial relations, psychology, operations, real estate, management, attracting the interest of scholars in multiple disciplines. Findings regarding challenges are presented below, but it is important to note that many mainstream models, largely developed with face-to-face workers in mind, often fail to account for the way telecommuters and virtual workers have challenged traditional labor structures. Technology and Common Ground When team members are highly dispersed, members are embedded in different external contexts and thus have less shared contextual knowledge, leading participants to take for granted common knowledge. Sole and Edmondson (2002) call this “situated knowledge,” finding evidence that the majority of conceptual misunderstandings resulted from lack of awareness of or failure to appropriate such knowledge. Such lack of mutual knowledge of each other’s situations increases coordination problems in acquiring knowledge and resources. Transactive memory is difficult to establish in virtual teams as it is often not transferred to new members, contextual knowledge is not kept or well-documented, and communication is indirect or infrequent. Development of this type of common ground is particularly difficult in virtual teams which are structurally dynamic or experience high turnover, as teams with a short history together tend to lack effective patterns of information sharing and working together, limiting the amount and variety of information that can be communicated across team members. One way to develop common ground in virtual teams is to develop a psychologically safe communication climate which acts as a moderating variable that can overcome mistrust and turn the team’s fluid membership into a source of new ideas and expertise. A supportive communication climate includes variables such as participation in decision-making, encouraging members to speak up, raising differences for discussion, engaging in spontaneous and informal communication, providing unsolicited information, remaining open to new ideas and perspectives, and bridging differences by suspending judgment. This helps to create trust and reduce perceptions of risk and uncertainty about members’ motives, in turn creating incentives to build a shared history. Another way to develop common knowledge rests on managers’ ability to act as politicians to manage the power dynamic inside and outside the team. This may reduce members’ hesitancy to share information, leading to enhanced innovation. A study by Gibbs and her colleagues (2021) indicates that managers can also bridge imbalances in situated knowledge during meetings by discussing trivial topics and surfacing taken-for-granted assumptions as a way to elicit differing opinions and hidden knowledge. In one instance, a manager increased dialogue among team members by deliberately refraining from giving people answers in order to encourage them to cooperate and co-create knowledge. Though more difficult than in collocated teams, careful management and co-presence strategies can successfully establish common ground among members of a virtual team.

        "prompt": "technology replaces face-to-face communication, it is often difficult to keep track of the messages that have been both sent and received by a receiver and vice versa. For instance, if collaborators have two email addresses, a primary and a secondary one, some messages may be sent by the server to the primary addresses and some to the secondary addresses, leading to information loss and confusion among team members. Intimacy is further threatened as perceived electronic mediation increases because such mediation leads to uneven information transfer and coordination challenges and reduces the amount of informal interaction, as the number of casual encounters and unplanned conversations is much higher among collocated colleagues. Simultaneously, differences in native language and status- the “prestige, esteem, worth, or relative social position of an individual or group”- inhibit open dialogue and can lead to uneven participation, one-way flows of knowledge, and exclusion. These status differences are subjective and socially constructed through interpersonal processes of stratification that play out in both verbal and nonverbal communication. Consequently, teams which foster an open dialogic environment through conversational turn-taking, active listening, and energy-enhancing practices achieve better participation and overcome status differences, in turn boosting collective intelligence and limiting miscommunications. Strategies to mitigate uneven distribution of information include structure-enabling practices which promote equal participation, such as regular calls, clear agendas established in advance of meetings, rotating presentations to give voice to lower-status members, and post-call follow ups to ensure a sense of role clarity and predictability. Furthermore, fostering knowledge repositories which seek to not only create new knowledge but record and catalogue existing knowledge helps to mitigate uneven information distribution and facilitate ongoing knowledge transfer. Managers can make a big difference in team participation by establishing dialogic practices which build rapport and trust, strengthen team communication and participation, and invite input from everyone. These practices help to bridge status differences and ensure team members are on the same page. Differences in What Information is Salient Computer-mediated communication (CMC) reduces nonverbal cues about interpersonal affections such as tone, warmth, and attentiveness, which contribute to message clarity and communication richness, and collaborators who use CMC often use more direct styles of communication with fewer social cues than those in face-to-face conditions. Zhao (2003) found that communicators use physical and linguistic “co-presence”- the subjective perception of closeness versus distance to make inferences about one another’s knowledge. Virtual workers are likely to have reduced contact and exposure to strong organizational structures and processes (including organizational dress, symbols, rituals, and ceremonies) that typically foster organizational identification. Difficulty in interpreting knowledge reduces experimentation, which may impact the improvisation processes vital to engendering innovation. In face-to-face interaction, the speaker makes the importance of a message known through tone of voice, facial expression, and bodily gestures. The receiver may acknowledge understanding through exact feedback called “back-channel” communication, such as head nods, brief verbalizations like “yeah” and “okay,” or smiles. These methods of emphasis and feedback ensure parties are on common ground. However, these methods are often lost in digital means of communication. For example, in an e-mail exchange, the point of",

        "prompt": "message as intended by the sender may be overlooked, misinterpreted, or given different priority. Furthermore, messages met with silence are highly ambiguous and can act as a barrier to establishing common ground. For instance, silence can be due to technical problems within the technology that mediates the parties involved in communication, or it can be due to the fact that one of the partners is out of town and cannot reply to the message. Silence can also be taken in many ways, as agreement, disagreement, passive aggression, and indifference, or in the case of dispersed groups, that the message was undelivered. Silence may lead to conflict because it blurs the notion of what is known and unknown in the group, signaling the absence of common ground. Fully implementing “back-channel” communication can be time-consuming. The lack of convenient cues in digital communication make dispersed collaboration less conducive for the establishment of mutual knowledge. The challenges presented by electronic dependence may be mitigated through the use of technologies allowing for higher media richness, which help to provide context and nuance in virtual communications. Remote collaborations may be enhanced by co-presence design or the development of tools to enhance perceived co-presence such as online avatars or added conference call features like visual representation, turn taking, or private chat. Further, Maznevski and Chudoba (2000) found that developing predictable temporal rhythms of technology and routines of media usage improved close working relationships. Subsequent research has also highlighted the importance of co-presence for psychological well-being and productivity. Moreover, practices such as informal conversations among colleagues, virtual “water cooler chat,” personal introductions, and discussions on trivial topics help to build connectedness and trust among virtual teams. For instance, many companies during the Covid-19 pandemic introduced 1:1 buddies, virtual coffee breaks, and digital town halls in order to increase co-presence and team identification. Team members who trust one another are more likely to ask follow-up questions for clarification, avoid snap judgments born out of miscommunication, and accept others’ advice and information. This in turn reduces the challenges associated with lost social cues during digital communication. Differences in Speed, Timing, and Responsiveness Speed and timing of communication is inevitably not as uniformed in digital communication as it is in face-to-face interaction. This is due to the fact that some parties have more restricted access to communication than others. The differences in relative speed and timing of feedback and conference calls are aggravated by differences in time zones, which can sharpen status differences and bolster resentment from sidelined locations. One part of the team on one side of the world may be asleep during another part’s normal workday, and the group has to work around this. These issues may be ameliorated by alternating night and morning calls for each location, having two separate meetings for different zones, or asking certain locations to participate in calls at unusual hours. In some cases, the problems arising from differences in relative speed may be attributed instead to a lack of conscientiousness on the part of the slower partners. In fact, a fluctuating feedback cycle",

Asynchronous communication tends to be more difficult to manage and requires much greater coordination than synchronous communication. As Gibson et al. (2011) found, developing consistent, time-patterned routines of communication may help to build close working relationships. Technology affordances such as a public forum where team members can post and reply to questions may also encourage timely responses and enhance ongoing knowledge transfer. In other instances, low responsiveness stems from cultural norms which dictate how quickly workers are expected to respond and when they can be reached. For example, one study found that Western Australians may express a “can do” attitude and a direct communication style while Jamaicans tend to be more conflict-avoidant in organizational settings and have a more fluid orientation to time. These cultural differences play an important role in how power and status differences are fostered and how they impact participation in teams. Rather than “sweeping them under the rug,” it is important to acknowledge differences in culture or opinion so they can be addressed through adaptation and agreeable solutions. Shared norms which bridge the differences can help resolve potential conflicts in preferences. Virtual teams have also historically highlighted a generational gap, as many older executives and senior managers do not have as much experience with computer technology as their younger counterparts. These senior members must then exert extra energy to catch up to the younger generation and navigate new means of communicating. This difficulty is less pertinent today, as most workers have some level of fluency with digital media and firms often provide training to equalize workers’ knowledge of communication tools. Emerging Issues Covid-19 Pandemic As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the virtual dimension of teamwork has gained greater prominence everywhere from social media to academic scholarship. Research on remote work has largely focused on outcomes differentiating between individuals who do and do not engage in remote work. However, as Zhang, Yu and Marin (2021) point out, during the Covid-19 pandemic, many employees were forced to work remotely. The beginning of the pandemic was marked by a rapid transition to virtual work, closures of traditional workspaces, physical distancing requirements, difficulties distributing technology and adapting to at-home work conditions, and feelings of isolation and hopelessness among newly virtual employees. Within this, the employee satisfaction and health outcomes associated with virtual work, largely neglected by pre-pandemic literature, have quickly come to the forefront of management research. Pre-pandemic studies found that the high levels of perceived electronic dependence and lack of copresence which often accompany virtual work can negatively affect critical psychological states of experienced meaningfulness, experienced responsibility, and knowledge of results. Likewise, while a supportive communication climate predicts satisfaction and commitment and includes variables such as participation in decision-making and communication openness, these factors are more difficult to establish in virtual settings. Thus, satisfaction among the team members of a virtual team has been shown to be less positive than satisfaction among face-to-face teams. This drop in satisfaction is due in part to difficulties building trust without face-to-face",

However, effective management and adherence to proper goal setting principles specific to the nature of work virtual teams require can lead to improved team effectiveness. If a team and its corresponding management is not prepared for the challenges of a virtual team, this will be difficult to achieve. Recent research by Zhang, Yu, and Marin (2021: 802) discovered that workers had a generally positive attitude towards working at home, citing the availability of collaboration and communication tools, increased productivity, and remote learning and flexible work hours. Conversely, workers frequently complained that long hours of teleconferencing could be draining, individuals’ capacity to work remotely was impeded by suboptimal home office setups, information-sensitive work was susceptible to cyber-security attacks, and that decentralized set-ups harmed work team engagement. While some workers experienced improved work-life balance due to spending more time with family, others reported their work-life balance was harmed due to difficulties maintaining the boundary between family and work. Care in Connecting Rather than “social distancing,” Gibson (2020) proposes the approach Care in Connecting, which acknowledges the need for caution in terms of physical proximity, but also promotes the urgent need for compassion that individuals and organizations provide and receive. Care in Connecting centers around three principles which counter the prejudice, isolation, and hopelessness associated with social distancing: inclusion, copresence, and vitality. Care in Connecting creates inclusion when diverse voices are heard and incorporated online. A number of scholars addressing inclusion and intercultural collaboration have revealed the importance of recognizing the uniqueness of individual constituents while also cultivating a sense of belonging to a collectivity. Research shows that members who identify with their team are more likely to display desirable individual workplace outcomes such as helping behavior, organizational citizenship behavior, lowered social undermining and social loafing, lessened workplace bullying, and fewer turnover intentions. Organizations prioritizing inclusion during the pandemic have adopted approaches including overtime pay, unlimited sick days, paid leaves of absence, free trials of higher education to help connect job seekers to opportunities, and donated medical supplies. These inclusionary practices involve understanding employees’ unique experiences and avoiding assumptions, stereotypes, and grand generalizations. Care in Connecting also creates co-presence, the experience of psychological proximity achievable online, to counteract feelings of isolation felt as a result of social distancing (Gibson, 2020: 166). Key to virtual team effectiveness is the team’s ability to understand which tool is most effective given the task and to selectively tailor combinations of technology to achieve copresence. Many organizations have sought to implement new practices during the pandemic to build a sense of copresence by ensuring access to technology and establishing the human element. Examples include purchasing laptops and audio equipment for workers, loaning tablets to students, implementing virtual coffee breaks or lunches, inviting workers’ children to join meetings, and promoting opportunities to connect as human beings. Finally, Care in Connecting can enable vitality, a sense of psychological and physical energy, to address the sense of hopelessness engendered by social distancing.

Organizations which provided examples of positivity and resilience in online interactions were able to spark positive emotional contagion and increased vitality. Many organizations communicated simple messages of care and composure, offered morning meditation sessions, allowed pets on screen for relaxation, conducted online yoga and fitness sessions, and sent out care packages to employees. Emerging Research There is still much unknown about the impact of Covid-19 on virtual teamwork, particularly in how employees will respond in the long-term to the blurring of public and private space and how the reorganization of reopened sites will unfold. Emerging research suggests that returning to work in the “new normal” after being out of work or teleworking to some capacity creates issues with employee focus, engagement, and mental reattachment to upcoming work. Furthermore, Shao et al. (2021) argue that workers’ newfound flexibility in working from home or at the office is impacted by stressors they encountered on the previous day. This research has implications for understanding the driving factors of daily work location choices, and how telework will unfold in a post-Covid world. Another research concern centers on the nonnegligible chance of community transmission in the workplace which poses a threat to returning workers. While many workplaces shut down following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, others in essential industries had to remain operational, thus exposing employees to virus dangers. However, firms varied significantly in the degree to which they took action to protect their employees. Steinbach, Kautz and Korsgaard (2021) found that these firm compensation actions were associated with a growth in positive stakeholder sentiment. The reintegration of workers into face-to-face work settings has also launched academic debate on privacy and ethical concerns surrounding mandatory vaccination requirements and/or weekly testing. While our knowledge of online collaboration has yet to incorporate the dynamic urgency created by the pandemic, it is very likely that closures of traditional workplaces, physical distancing requirements, and the difficulties firms face reopening sites will fundamentally shift research on virtual work.

History In the early modern period, the Dutch were the pioneers in financial regulation. The first recorded ban (regulation) on short selling was enacted by the Dutch authorities as early as 1610. Aims of regulation The objectives of financial regulators are usually: market confidence – to maintain confidence in the financial system financial stability – contributing to the protection and enhancement of stability of the financial system consumer protection – securing the appropriate degree of protection for consumers. reduce financial crime regulate foreign participation Structure of supervision Acts empower organizations, government or non-government, to monitor activities and enforce actions. There are various setups and combinations in place for the financial regulatory structure around the globe.

Most prominent the pricing process, execution and settlement of trades, direct and efficient trade monitoring. Supervision of listed companies Financial regulators ensure that listed companies and market participants comply with various regulations under the trading acts. The trading acts demands that listed companies publish regular financial reports, ad hoc notifications or directors' dealings. Whereas market participants are required to publish major shareholder notifications. The objective of monitoring compliance by listed companies with their disclosure requirements is to ensure that investors have access to essential and adequate information for making an informed",

But in some cases, there are specific authorities to regulate each sector of the finance industry, mainly banking, securities, insurance and pensions markets, but in some cases also commodities, futures, forwards, etc. For example, in Australia, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) supervises banks and insurers, while the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is responsible for enforcing financial services and corporations laws. Sometimes more than one institution regulates and supervises the banking market, normally because, apart from regulatory authorities, central banks also regulate the banking industry. For example, in the USA banking is regulated by a lot of regulators, such as the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, as well as regulators at the state level. In the European Union, the European System of Financial Supervision consists of the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) as well as the European Systemic Risk Board.

Regulatory reliance on credit rating agencies Think-tanks such as the World Pensions Council (WPC) have argued that most European governments pushed dogmatically for the adoption of the Basel II recommendations, adopted in 2005, transposed in European Union law through the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), effective since 2008. In essence, they forced European banks, and, more importantly, the European Central Bank itself e.g. when gauging the solvency of EU-based financial institutions, to rely more than ever on the standardized assessments of credit risk marketed by two private US agencies- Moody's and S&P, thus using public policy and ultimately taxpayers’ money to strengthen an anti-competitive duopolistic industry.

Despite its broad powers, the personal power of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union was significantly limited. For example, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers did not have the right to independently appoint and dismiss members of the government of the Soviet Union – including ministers and chairmen of state committees – and other members of the government; this right belonged to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (and in the period between its sessions – the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet). The appointment of deputy ministers of the Soviet Union, deputy chairmen of state committees of the Soviet Union and members of collegiums of ministries and state committees, as well as issues of the country's economic policy and its implementation by central government bodies, were the subject of collegial consideration by members of the government. The same applied to decisions on the creation, reorganization, abolition, personnel and activities of subordinate bodies of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, including bodies created to systematically check the implementation of government decisions. These decisions were not taken by the head of government alone, but by a majority vote of the members of the Council of Ministers or its Presidium.

It is the oldest state experiment station in the United States, having been founded in 1875. Its official mission is to \"develop, advance, and disseminate scientific knowledge, improve agricultural productivity and environmental quality, protect plants, and enhance human health and well-being through research for the benefit of Connecticut residents and the nation.\" The station operates a main research campus in New Haven, a research farm in Hamden, a satellite research facility and farm in Windsor, and a research farm in Griswold. The Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station is a separate agricultural research agency, founded in 1887 and part of the University of Connecticut, which also receives state and federal funding. Historic campus in New Haven The experiment station's main facility in the Prospect Hill area of New Haven dates from 1882 when it became the permanent home of the first state agricultural experiment station. The station had been founded at Wesleyan University in 1875 and moved to Yale in 1877 as it became associated with the Sheffield Scientific School. By 1882, the station needed more space, and Sheffield needed its space back. A property at the top of Prospect Hill was purchased and buildings built, using a $25,000 appropriation from the state legislature. The buildings include the Osborne Library, built in 1882-83 and believed to be the oldest building at any state agricultural experimental station, and the Johnson Laboratory, which has notably large brackets supporting its wide overhanging eaves. The station was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964, recognizing its significance as the first state agricultural station in the nation. For much of its history, the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station worked closely with the Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station, which was founded in 1887 at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. The main campus in New Haven currently houses the activities of six departments: Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry and Genetics, Entomology, Environmental Sciences, Forestry and Horticulture and Plant Pathology and Ecology. Recent research activities Analytical Chemistry The founding department of the Station, Analytical Chemistry began its work in 1875 testing fertilizer and later seeds, animal feed, human foods, drugs, and pesticides.

The department also has the capability to test for environmental contaminants and toxins in toys and other consumer products at very low concentrations. They test soils for heavy metals, and are investigating the cycling of organic pollutants in the environment, with an emphasis on phytoremediation issues. Additional investigations on the impact of nanoparticles on agricultural crops and on the potential contamination of the food chain are also being undertaken. Work has also been conducted in collaboration with Biochemistry and Genetics as well as colleagues from the Valley Laboratory to investigate which seed crops are best suited for the production of biodiesel in Connecticut. Recently, the department has been working with the US FDA on the testing of seafood from the Gulf of Mexico for chemical by-products of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Biochemistry and Genetics Biochemistry research began at the station in 1888 with the appointment of Thomas B. Osborne and Samuel W. Johnson to study plant proteins. Today, the department focuses largely on plant genetics to identify and clone beneficial plant genes to improve crop species. Recent work includes the control of soil-borne pests by cloning genes from plants in the mustard family (Brassicaceae) that enable plants to protect their roots from nematodes. Work is also conducted on elucidating the genetic basis for photosynthetic performance in plant leaves (10). Furthermore, the department helps protect honeybee colonies by developing early-detection tests for American Foulbrood(AFB) disease, and establish protocols to control the causal bacterium. This department was blended with other departments starting in 2015. Entomology The department is continuing its pioneering research on Lyme disease and its vector in Connecticut, the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis); biological control of ticks using the fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae; and has developed new testing methods for tick-borne illnesses in humans, wildlife and domesticated animals. Every year, thousands of ticks are sent in from around the state to be tested for disease agents. The department also conducts research on the biology and control of exotic insects, including the invasive Asian long-horned beetle and emerald ash borer, looking at the chemistry of tree selection and mating behavior. The Entomology department supports agricultural production in Connecticut with integrated pest management (IPM) efforts, helping reduce pesticide use. Environmental Sciences The Experiment Station has conducted research on mosquitoes and the diseases they carry since 1909. This work is carried on today within the Environmental Sciences Department (formerly “Soil and Water”). Mosquitoes are collected from around the state of Connecticut then tested for West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis and other disease-causing agents. Researchers have also undertaken an effort to map the distribution of invasive aquatic plants within the state and investigate methods to control their growth and spread. Scientists are also conducting research on Phytoremediation, which focuses on the ability of certain cucurbit species to remove persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as PCBs and DDT from soil.

Scientists have also studied white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) behavior in hopes of keeping these animals away from highways to prevent vehicle-deer collisions, and to reduce damage to tree saplings, crops, and gardens. The department has surveyed certain forest plots every decade since 1927 (with the exception of 1947), providing information about how forests change over long periods of time. Researchers have also investigated techniques for crop-tree management that both increases yields and improves forest health. Department scientists are currently investigating the association of Japanese barberry (an invasive shrub), white-footed mice, and Ixodes ticks that carry the Lyme disease organism and other human pathogens in the state's forests, and cost-effective means to control invasive plant species. Plant Pathology and Ecology The plant pathology and ecology department works to expand knowledge of ecological interactions of plants, pathogens, and their environment to develop management strategies for plant pathogens with minimal use of pesticides. Current research includes investigating the use of nanoparticles of metal oxides on plant diseases, deciphering the role of soil protists in crop health, investigating the genetic structure in natural populations of a fungus causing perennial cankers of birch, understanding the genetics of pathogenic bacteria, and protecting CT vineyards from new viral pathogens. The department also runs a full service Plant Diagnostic Information Office and serves as the official seed testing laboratory for the state of Connecticut. Valley Laboratory Previously referred to as the “Tobacco Substation,” the Valley Laboratory in Windsor, CT has a long history of improving the cultivation of tobacco leaves in Connecticut for use as fine cigar wrappers. The “Tobacco Laboratory,” (now simply the Valley Laboratory) building was completed in 1941. Today, research covers areas such as the production of biofuel crops, invasive plant management, developing integrated pest management (IPM) methods for Connecticut nurseries, and management of the exotic hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). Lockwood Farm The research farm is named after William Raymond Lockwood. He was a resident of Norwalk, CT who willed his estate to CAES, proceeds from the sale of which went towards the purchase of 20 acres of land in the Mount Carmel area of Hamden, CT in 1909(12). During the mid-twentieth century, James G. Horsfall (former Station Director) used the farm to test organically-derived fungicides as a replacement for the heavy metals used to treat plant diseases at the time. Since 1931, the farm managers have taken daily, systematic weather measurements which provide information that can be used to study Connecticut's climate. Many plant varieties and growing methods are tested. Every year in August the farm hosts the annual Plant Science Day. Griswold Research Center The most recent addition to the CT Agricultural Experiment Station's holdings, Griswold Research Center, encompasses 14 acres of farmland in Griswold, CT and an additional parcel of forest in the adjacent town of Voluntown, CT.

Andreadis (2013–2020) Dr. Jason C. White (2020–present) Notable scientific contributions Amino acids and the discovery of vitamins In 1909 station chemist Thomas B. Osborne began collaborating with Lafayette Mendel of Yale University to test the nutritive value of the proteins that Osborne had isolated from crop seeds. Through feeding trials with albino rats, they determined that the type and quality of protein actually was more important to growth than quantity. They found that certain amino acids were lacking in the proteins isolated from grains. For example, when rats were given only zein, found in corn, as their protein source in an otherwise complete diet, their health declined and they died. This occurred because zein lacks the essential amino acids lysine and tryptophan. When the researchers added tryptophan to the isolated zein, rats were able to survive but did not grow. When both tryptophan and lysine were added, the rats both survived and grew rapidly. Osborne and Mendel also found that the gliadin, the protein found in wheat was lacking certain amino acids, and that like corn, these deficiencies could be amended by combining grain foods with animal proteins such as eggs or milk. This experiment demonstrated that animals need to acquire certain amino acids from food, which are now referred to as the essential amino acids. In their study of proteins, Osborne and Mendel also aided in the discovery of vitamins. During their feeding trials, they noticed that young rats fed diets with sufficient carbohydrate (in the form of wheat flour) and purified protein, but with vegetable fats or lard instead of butter grew and developed normally for around eighty days, then suddenly began to decline in health and weight then soon died. Many of the animals also developed sore eyes or even ulcers on their eyeballs. Something other than carbohydrates, fats and complete proteins was missing from this artificial diet. When a small amount of butter was added to the feed mixture, the afflicted rats soon recovered completely and continued growing. Whole-milk powder also had the same effect on rat growth. In 1913, the Station's Annual Report stated that “experiments have shown that some still unknown substance is essential to growth and that this unknown substance is present in milk. Much work is being done in an effort to discover an isolate this substance.” As it turns out, this substance was Vitamin A. Concurrently with Osborne and Mendel, Elmer V. McCollum (a former student of Osborne) and Marguerite Davis at the University of Wisconsin were obtaining similar results, and although the scientists submitted their report for publication several weeks prior",

East and Herbert K. Hayes began attempts to improve the quality and yield of corn (Zea mays) through selective breeding and hybridization. In 1906, East realized that steps to prevent self- and close-fertilization made it easier to select for desirable traits (such as large ear size) when breeding. Hayes and East later found described that a cross, or hybrid, between two inbred varieties of corn produced offspring that was more vigorous, larger and hardier that both of the parents, but this improvement was lost over successive inbred generations. In 1914, Donald F. Jones arrived at the station at the age of twenty-five, and began to build upon the work of East and Hayes. By 1917, he had published his theory of “heterosis,” which explained the increased vigor and yield observed in hybrid maize. The same year, he created a double-cross hybrid corn by breeding two separate hybrid individuals. This new cross descended from four distinct inbred lines, and was even more vigorous than either of its parents. However, like the single-cross hybrid, this improvement was lost over subsequent generations of inbreeding. Jones published his double-cross method in 1919, and began actively promoting the technique as a means to improve corn production nationally: “it is something that may easily be taken up by seedsmen; in fact, it is the first time in agricultural history that a seedsman is enabled to gain full benefit from a desirable origination of his own… The utilization of first generation hybrids enables to originator to keep the parental types and give out only the crossed seeds, which are less valuable for continued propagation.” Because corn is a self-fertilizing plant, the prevention of inbreeding when producing hybrid seeds required time-consuming detasseling. In the 1940s and 50's, Jones collaborated with Paul Mangelsdorf of Harvard University to eliminate the need to remove the tassels from plants in seed production through utilizing a sterile plant and male restorer gene, making the production of corn more cost-efficient. \"Morgan\" method of soil testing Dr. M. F. Morgan, Chief of Soils Department for twenty years, developed a method that still bears his name to test for soil nutrients that are available to plants using weak acids. This test was able to estimate deficiencies or excesses of plant nutrients in soil. Dr. Morgan was also a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army during World War II, and was killed in action on the Leyte Island in the Philippines in 1945. Morgan's soil test became the world's first widely accepted method for efficiently estimating soil fertility, and is still in use today. Tick-borne diseases In 1975, there was a cluster of juvenile arthritis patients in the towns of Lyme and Old Lyme, CT, and scientists at the Station were among the first to determine that this disease was carried by ticks.

Timeline of significant events 1875: The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station is established; the first in the United States, and precursor for the nation's industrial research laboratories; founded twenty-five years prior to the General Electric laboratories, which was the first of its kind. 1882: The Station moves to its current location on Huntington Street in New Haven, land purchased from the Eli Whitney, Jr. family 1890: Dr. Roland Thaxter, botanist at the Station, determines the cause of potato scab (an actinomycete that infects tubers). 1900: Sumatran tobacco was planted under cloth canopies in Connecticut in an effort to simulate Sumatra's tropical climate. The resulting shade grown tobacco was considered second to none for making cigar wrappers and consequently revolutionized the industry in the Connecticut Valley. 1903: State entomologist William E. Britton and G. P. Clinton issue the first pesticide “spray calendar” to be used by Connecticut farmers. 1905: The first gypsy moth discovered in Connecticut was found in Stonington, CT by E.

For this reason it has a similar vibrational spectrum to carbon dioxide. Historically, the nitronium ion was detected by Raman spectroscopy, because its symmetric stretch is Raman-active but infrared-inactive. The Raman-active symmetrical stretch was first used to identify the ion in nitrating mixtures. Salts A few stable nitronium salts with anions of weak nucleophilicity can be isolated. These include nitronium perchlorate , nitronium tetrafluoroborate , nitronium hexafluorophosphate , nitronium hexafluoroarsenate , and nitronium hexafluoroantimonate . These are all very hygroscopic compounds. The solid form of dinitrogen pentoxide, , actually consists of nitronium and nitrate ions, so it is an ionic compound, nitronium nitrate , not a molecular solid. However, dinitrogen pentoxide in liquid or gaseous state is molecular and does not contain nitronium ions. Related species The compounds nitryl fluoride, , and nitryl chloride, , are not nitronium salts but molecular compounds, as shown by their low boiling points (−72 °C and −6 °C respectively) and short nitrogen–halogen bond lengths (N–F 135 pm, N–Cl 184 pm).

Although he pleaded not guilty, Andrew Kalajzich, the victim’s husband, was found guilty of her murder in May 1988, and sentenced to 25 years in prison without parole. He was released from prison on 8 February 2012. Background Andrew Kalajzich was born in Australia in 1941, after his parents migrated from Yugoslavia in 1939. He grew up working in his family’s fish shop in Manly, and by the age of 25 he and his brother established their own business in Manly. He married Megan Carmichael in 1962 and they had two children together, Michelle and Andrew. In the following years Kalajzich became a well-respected and wealthy figure on the Northern Beaches of Sydney. He was elected the president of the Manly Chamber of Commerce in 1972, and opened the Manly Pacific International Hotel in 1983. Just 16 days before Megan’s death she was attacked at her Fairlight home at gunpoint, however the gun failed to fire. In the early morning of 27 January 1986, Megan Kalajzich was shot twice in the head as she slept beside her husband in their home. Two shots were also fired into Andrew Kalajzich’s pillow; he claims that he was able to roll out of the way of the bullets. Legal proceedings In an 11-week trial at the NSW Supreme Court during early 1988, Andrew Kalajzich was found guilty of the murder of his wife. Evidence was provided that Mr Kalajzich had hired hitman Bill Vandenberg, paying him $20,000 to murder his wife. Therefore, Kalajzich was",

Kalajzich and his children have continued to maintain that he is innocent of the charges. After serving 25 years in prison, it was announced on 25 January 2012 that Kalajzich would be released on parole. He was subsequently released on 8 February 2012. Media The Megan Kalajzich murder was the focus of the Crime Investigation Australia episode \"Contract to Kill\".

Géré) († 1033), Lord of Echauffour and Montreuil-l'Argillé, was a knight from Brittany who became a Norman nobleman and the progenitor of a large family in Normandy, England, and Apulia. Career Giroie was the son of Arnold-le-Gros, of Courcerault, who was in turn the son of Abbo the Breton. Giroie's arrival in Normandy from Brittany did not apparently raise concerns with Richard II, Duke of Normandy, but was challenged by Gilbert, Count of Brionne whose lands nearby were threatened by the newcomer and his followers. Duke Richard intervened only to maintain the peace in the area and not to repel the newly settled Giroie. Giroie was a formidable knight and a vassal of William of Bellême. In battle against Herbert I, Count of Maine, William and his followers were overwhelmed and fled the battlefield, but Giroie and his small force held their ground and defeated Herbert's forces completely. It was a famous victory at the time and Heugon, a powerful Norman, offered Giroie his only daughter in marriage along with the lordships of Montreuil, Echauffour and all adjoining lands. Heugon's daughter died before the wedding could take place. William de Bellême then introduced Giroie to Richard II, Duke of Normandy at Rouen, who, in recognition of his great accomplishments granted the lands of Heugon to Giroie. On returning from Rouen, Giroie then married Gisle, daughter of Thurston de Bastembourg, lord of Montfort-sur-Risle. He and several of his relatives were vassals of the de Belléme family. After succeeding to the lands of Heugon, Giroie discovered the ecclesiastical houses in his domain were under no bishopric. He further inquired to find the most devout of the bishops surrounding his lands and found that to be Roger, Bishop of Lisieux. Giroie then convinced several of his neighbors including Baldric de Bauquencei and his sons-in-law Wascelin du Pont-Echanfré and Roger de Merlerault to place their religious houses under the same bishopric. They approached Roger, Bishop of Lisieux who granted their requests and further granted the clergy of these churches an exemption from any and all archdeacon's visitations.

After his death, and only two of his sons being of age his lands were attacked again by Gilbert of Brionne, seeking an easy victory and wanting to add these lands to those of his own. The two sons, gathering up all their kinsmen and vassals, soundly defeated Gilbert's forces. By way of revenge the family of Giroie then took Sap by force. At this point Robert I, Duke of Normandy stepped in and commending the brothers, knighting both of them, he caused Gilbert to cede Sap to them and implored all parties to end their war.

The Shawnee people thought that a very narrow and straight creek above the waterfall on the Hockhocking River resembled a bottle's neck. Other notable settlers were George Starkey and Moses Dolson. The first election on county matters was held in Eby's mill near Queer Creek. The first post office in the area was called the \"Rockhouse\" and was located in Herschel Badford's home.

Modeled on the Salon des Refusés, it is Denmark's oldest association of artists. Now located on Copenhagen's Oslo Plads next to Østerport Station, it works as an arts centre, continuing to exhibit works created and selected by contemporary artists rather than those chosen by cultural authorities. History The organization was initiated by the painter Johan Rohde (1856–1935) and included several founding members: Jens Ferdinand Willumsen, Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen, Vilhelm Hammershøi, Johanne Cathrine Krebs, the couple Harald and Agnes Slott-Møller, Christian Mourier-Petersen and Malthe Engelsted. The first exhibition in 1891 presented 100 works by 18 artists, including Peder Severin Krøyer, Julius Paulsen and Kristian Zahrtmann, who were among Denmark's greatest painters of the period. The first exhibition was hosted by Kleis' Kunsthandel, a combined art gallery and gilder's business situated at Vesterbrogade 58 in Vesterbro. It opened on 27 March 1891. In 1893, Thorvald Bindesbøll designed a wooden pavilion for the association on a plot near City Hall Square in the very centre of Copenhagen. That year, international painters such as Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh exhibited works there. In 1898, Den Frie Udstilling moved to Aborreparken where a new pavilion inspired by Egyptian and Greek temples was designed by Willumsen who added an octagonal extension in 1905. As today, the facade was decorated with a relief of Pegasus, a symbol of freely inspired art drawn from Greek mythology. In 1913,",

In 1987, Den Frie Udstilling became a listed building. Although comprehensive restoration work was completed in 2006, further improvements reflecting Williumsen's original designs will be completed in 2014. There will also be significant extensions. Current exhibitions Den Frie Udstilling continues to exhibit contemporary art selected by the artists who are members of the association. As a result, the building hosts exhibitions of experimental art and related activities. The association's goal is to act as a platform for artistic divergence, reducing the gap between tradition and innovation. While a focus on artists' collectives and experimental groups is maintained, there are also exhibitions devoted to promising new artists or those who have made an important contribution to the history of art.

A Gaelic alliance led by Brian O'Neill (High-King of Ireland) and Hugh O'Connor were defeated by the Normans. The forces of Brian O'Neill had been raiding the Norman Earldom of Ulster after 1257 in an attempt to assert their independence and form a coalition of the Irish against the Normans. O'Neill allied with Hugh McPhelim O'Connor (Aedh mac Fedhlimidh Ua Conchobhair) of Connacht and together with their men went into battle against the Normans. According to the Annals of Innisfallen, the Normans had gathered an army of mostly Irish Gaelic levies to fight against the coalition, and the Normans themselves played only a small role in the fighting. Many of the Irish clans in Leinster, Ulster, Munster, Meath, and Breifne, which were under Norman rule at the time, provided the Normans with the bulk of their fighting forces, serving as mercenaries and retained bands. Thus, most of the battles between the Normans and Irish at this time would have seemed more like battles between the Irish themselves. Brian O'Neill was defeated and killed together with a number of O'Cahan chiefs. The Annals of Innisfallen state:Brian Ua Neill, king of Cenél Eógain, to whom the Gaedil gave hostages, and who paid-neither tax nor tribute to the king of England, was slain by the Gaedil (Irish) themselves and by some of the foreigners (Anglo-Normans) {at Dún dá Lethglas}.

Although the Unionist Party received the most votes, the South African National Party of General Louis Botha won a slim majority. The Unionist Party became the official opposition. Electoral system The South Africa Act 1909 provided that the franchise in each province should be the same as that in the corresponding colony before the Union, until altered by the Union Parliament. The Act included entrenching clauses, providing that black and coloured voters could only be removed from the common voters roll in the Cape of Good Hope, by legislation passed by a two-thirds majority by both houses of Parliament in joint session. The franchise, in all parts of the Union, was limited to men over the age of 21. There were some additional qualifications and disqualifications which varied between provinces. The franchise in the Orange Free State and Transvaal was limited to white men. The traditional \"Cape Qualified Franchise\" system of the Cape of Good Hope was based on property and wage qualifications, equally open to people of all races. At the time of the National Convention in 1908, which drafted the terms of what became the South Africa Act, \"22,784 Native and Coloured persons out of a total of 152,221 electors\" were entitled to vote in Cape elections. Natal had a theoretically non-racial franchise, but in practice few non-white electors ever qualified. It was estimated, in 1908, that \"200 non-Europeans out of a total of 22,786 electors had secured franchise rights\". The South Africa Act 1909 provided for single member electoral divisions, with members of the House of Assembly being elected using the relative majority (also known as first past the post) electoral system.

Registrants work in NHS hospitals, private health care, academic institutions and the medical device industry. History The Register was formed in August 2000 as the Voluntary Register of Clinical Technologists (VCRT), with the aim of protecting the public by advocating statutory, professional regulation for Clinical Technologists. Management of the Register was undertaken by members of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM), the Association of Renal Technologists and the Institution of Incorporated Engineers (now the Institution of Engineering and Technology). At its formation, the Register was designed to be a platform for the Clinical Technologist profession’s campaign for statutory regulation with the then Health Professions’ Council (HPC). However, in 2011 the UK Government Command Paper ‘Enabling Excellence: Autonomy and Accountability for Health and Social Care Staff’ stated that extensions to statutory regulation \"will only be considered where there is a compelling case on the basis of a public safety risk and where assured voluntary registers are not considered sufficient to manage this risk\", and indicated that the way forward would be via assured voluntary registration. This was subsequently developed into a system of Accredited Registers administered by the Profession Standards Authority (PSA). In 2013, at the request of the VCRT Management Panel, the management of the register was integrated into the professional work of IPEM, in order to provide a firmer footing for an application to the PSA to become an Accredited Register In 2015, the Register was successful in achieving accreditation.

Following the outbreak of World War II, the 37th Battalion served in a garrison role until 1942 when it was once again amalgamated with the 52nd Battalion. History World War I The 37th Battalion was originally raised in Seymour, Victoria, in February 1916 as part of an expansion of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) which took place following the end of the Gallipoli campaign. The unit was made up from personnel drawn from men originating from Victoria who were recruited from a number of areas including Melbourne, Gippsland and the north-eastern parts of the state. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Frederick George Woods, the battalion became part of the 10th Brigade attached to the 3rd Australian Division. Initial training took place in Australia, however, once this was complete the battalion was sent to Britain where they concentrated on Salisbury Plain along with the rest of the 3rd Division to undertake more advanced training. The process took a considerable period of time and as such it was not until late in the year that the 3rd Division was declared ready to be deployed to the Western Front. After the battalion arrived in France on 23 November 1916, it was first sent to the Armentières sector which was considered a \"quiet\" area where the newly arrived troops could gain their first experiences of trench warfare. While there, they undertook patrols into No Man's Land and minor raids on the German trenches opposite them during the winter months. After winter had subsided, in April 1917 the 3rd Division was moved to the Messines–Wytschaete Ridge section of the line in Belgium, where they began to prepare to take part in their first major battle of the war. Between 7 and 9 June 1917, the battalion took part in the fighting at Messines in Belgium. One of the battalion's officers, Captain Robert Grieve was later awarded the Victoria Cross for the role he played in the battle. Following this, the 37th Battalion saw service at Broodseinde on 4 October and then later at Passchendaele on 12 October. In early 1918, the collapse of the Russian resistance on the Eastern Front enabled the Germans to transfer a large number of troops to the west. As a result, in March, they launched an offensive along the Western Front. The initial attack was quite successful and with the Germans making rapid gains, many Australian units, including the 37th Battalion, which was moved from Armentières and to Ypres, were thrown into the line to blunt the attack. In late March, the battalion took part in a defensive action around Dernancourt. Finally the German offensive stalled and, after a period, the Allies were able to launch their own offensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, which ultimately brought about an end to the war.

After this, it took part in a number of actions, including those at Bray and Clery, as the 3rd Division advanced through the Somme Valley towards Buire. As a result of heavy casualties sustained by the AIF during 1918 and a lack of new recruits with which to make up these losses, in September the AIF was forced to disband a number of battalions in order to reinforce others. With orders to disband, the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Story, was relieved of command for questioning and failing to follow the order. The men mutinied and, as a result, the order was rescinded, albeit on a temporary basis. On 29 September, the battalion took part in its final battle of the war when it was involved in the attack on the St Quentin Canal. After this, the battalion was finally disbanded on 12 October 1918, at which point it only had a frontage of 60 men. During the fighting, it suffered lost 483 killed in action or died on active service and 1,485 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Victoria Cross, two Distinguished Service Orders (DSO), 15 Military Crosses (MCs), 8 Distinguished Conduct Medals (DCMs), 67 Military Medals (MMs) with one Bar, six Meritorious Service Medals (MSMs), 13 Mentions in Despatches (MIDs) and two foreign awards. The 37th was awarded 14 battle honours for its involvement in the fighting on the Western Front. Inter-war years In 1921, Australia's part-time military forces were re-organised in order to perpetuate the numerical designations and formations of the AIF. As a result, the 37th Battalion was re-raised at this time, drawing personnel from parts of the 24th, 46th and 37th Infantry Regiments and the 29th Light Horse, and was assigned to the 10th Brigade, which was attached to the 3rd Division. In 1927, when territorial designations were adopted, the battalion became known as '\"The Henty Regiment\". That year, the 37th adopted the motto of \"Indivisible\". The battalion was amalgamated with the 52nd Battalion in 1930 as the \"37th/52nd Battalion (The Henty Regiment)\", which was formed in the state of Victoria as part of a rationalisation of the Australia's part-time military forces that came about as a result of the combined effects of the suspension of compulsory service by the newly elected Scullin Labor government and the Great Depression. The 37th/52nd Battalion remained in existence until 1937 when, as part of an expansion of the Australian military due to concerns about the threat of war in Europe, the battalion was split, and the 37th Battalion was amalgamated with the 39th Battalion; this remained until 24 August 1939 when the 37th was re-formed and the 39th Battalion was amalgamated with the 24th Battalion. An alliance with the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders was approved in the inter-war years.

Due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903), which precluded sending the Militia outside Australian territory, initially units such as the 37th Battalion were employed to provide training for personnel called up under the compulsory training scheme, which was reactivated in 1940. As a result, throughout 1940–41, as the Militia were called up to undertake periods of continuous training, the 37th Battalion undertook a number of training camps at Seymour. Following Japan's entry into the war in late 1941, they the units of the 3rd Division were mobilised for war service. In August 1942, however, having remained in Australia carrying out garrison duties and having not been deployed on active service overseas, the battalion was again amalgamated with the 52nd Battalion, this time in response to a manpower shortage in the Australian economy that had been brought about by an over mobilisation of Australia's military forces. At this point the battalion became known as the \"37th/52nd Battalion\" and initially, it was assigned to the 10th Brigade and attached to the 3rd Division, although it was later transferred to the 4th Brigade in September 1942 after the 10th Brigade was also disbanded.

At least from the accession of David I a less highly regarded order of bards took over their functions. They probably accompanied their poetry on the harp and harpists are recorded in the reign of Alexander III. James I may have introduced English and continental styles and musicians to the Scottish court. James III's founded a new large hexagonal Chapel Royal at Restalrig near Holyrood and lutenists began to appear in the royal household accounts from this point. James IV refounded the Chapel Royal within Stirling Castle and is said to be constantly accompanied by music. Scotland followed the trend of Renaissance courts for instrumental accompaniment and playing. James V was a talented lute player and introduced French chansons and consorts of viols to his court. The outstanding Scottish composer of the first half of the sixteenth century was Robert Carver. The king's household contained two dozen musicians, including trumpeters, drummers and string players. The return of Mary, Queen of Scots from France in 1561 gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Chapel Royal. She brought French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household. James VI rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling. He followed the tradition of employing lutenists for his private entertainment, as did other members of his family. When James VI went south to take the throne of England in 1603 as James I, he removed one of the major sources of patronage in Scotland. The Chapel Royal now began to fall into disrepair, and the court in Westminster would be the only major source of royal musical patronage. Holyrood Abbey was remodelled as a chapel for Charles I's royal visit in 1633, but musical worship in the palace came to an end after the chapel was sacked by a mob. Holyrood would be reclaimed by Charles II and became a centre of worship again during the future James VII's residency in the early 1680s, but was sacked by an anti-papist mob during the Glorious Revolution in 1688. Middle Ages Early Medieval Scotland and Ireland shared a common culture and language. There are much fuller historical sources for Ireland, which suggest that there would have been filidh in Scotland, who acted as poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king, and who passed on their knowledge and culture in Gaelic to the next generation. At least from the accession of David I (r. 1124–53), as part of a Davidian Revolution that introduced French culture and political systems, Gaelic ceased to be the main language of the royal court and was probably replaced by French.

They probably accompanied their poetry on the harp. When Alexander III (r. 1249–86) met Edward I in England he was accompanied by a Master Elyas, described as \"the king of Scotland's harper\". The same accounts indicate that the Scottish king was also accompanied by trumpeters and other minstrels. The captivity of James I in England from 1406 to 1423, where he earned a reputation as a poet and composer, may have led him to take English and continental styles and musicians back to the Scottish court on his release. Walter Bower, abbot of Inchcolm praised him as \"another Orpheus\", including mastery of the organ, drum, flute and lyre. James II also demonstrated some musical ability. His marriage to Mary of Guelders, who had been educated in the Burgundian court, meant that she brought the latest ideas of music to the Scottish court. The story of the execution of James III's favourites by his enemies, including the English musician William Roger, at Lauder Bridge in 1482, may indicate his interest in music. Renaissance monarchs often used chapels to impress visiting dignitaries. James III founded a new large hexagonal Chapel Royal at Restalrig near Holyrood that was probably designed for a large number of choristers. Lutenists began to appear in the royal household accounts from the reign of James III, with the earliest reference in 1474. In 1501 his son James IV refounded the Chapel Royal within Stirling Castle, with a new and enlarged choir meant to emulate St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle and it became the focus of Scottish liturgical music. Burgundian and English influences were probably reinforced when Henry VII's daughter Margaret Tudor married James IV in 1503. No piece of music can be unequivocally identified with these chapels, but the survival of a Mass based on the Burgundian song L'Homme armé in the later Carver Choirbook may indicate that this was part of the Chapel Royal repertoire. James IV was said to be constantly accompanied by music, but very little surviving secular music can be unequivocally attributed to his court. An entry in the accounts of the Lord Treasurer of Scotland indicates that when James IV was at Stirling on 17 April 1497, there was a payment \"to twa fithalaris [fiddlers] that sang Greysteil to the king, ixs\". Greysteil was an epic romance and the music survives, having been placed in a collection of lute airs in the seventeenth century. In the early sixteenth century there are records of the monarch being entertained in their privy chambers by musicians, among them singers and other musicians including an English cornet player. James IV had stands of French and Italian musicians. His musicians also included the first recorded Africans in Scotland. He employed an African drummer, noted in his accounts as the \"More taubronar\", playing a drum called a \"tabor\". James IV employed a blind lutenist, and helped a lutenist called Jacob redeem",

Early Modern Era Scotland followed the trend of Renaissance courts for instrumental accompaniment and playing. James V was a talented lute player and introduced French chansons and consorts of viols to his court, although almost nothing of this secular chamber music survives. The first indication of the use of viols is an entry in the Treasurer's accounts for 1535 for the making of viols. By 1538 there were four viol players in the household, dressed in red and yellow liveries. They were led by Jacques Collumbell, who seems to have been brought to Scotland to train the newly formed consort. James V's household contained two dozen musicians, including trumpeters, drummers and string players. These included Thomas de Avarencia, whose services were begged from the Duke of Milan. The outstanding Scottish composer of the first half of the sixteenth century was Robert Carver (c. 1488-1558), a canon of Scone Abbey. His complex polyphonic music could only have been performed by a large and highly trained choir such as the one employed in the Scottish Chapel Royal. James V was also a patron to figures including David Peebles (c. 1510–79?), whose best known work \"Si quis diligit me\" (text from John 14:23), is a motet for four voices. These were probably only two of many accomplished composers from this era, whose work has largely only survived in fragments. Also known to be active in this period is John Fethy (c. 1480-c. 1568), who introduced the new five-fingered organ playing technique to the country and was Precentor or Chanter of the Chapel Royal from 1545-66. Regent Arran, who ruled from 1543 to 1554, employed trumpeters and four viol players, and was entertained by a fool called Robesoun. The return of Mary, Queen of Scots from France in 1561 to begin her personal reign, and her position as a Catholic, gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Chapel Royal, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, bagpipes and tabors. Like her father she played the lute and virginals, while unlike her father she was a fine singer. She brought French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household. She sent Adrian Lefeau to France to buy lutes and viols. Mary had a stand of musicians for singing part works. These included French, Italian and English musicians. Among these was David Rizzio, later her private secretary until his murder in 1566. Her marriage to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley in 1565 has the first references to members of the English Hudson family, with at least five members, who would be violers and singers at the court of James VI.

James VI and the Union of the Crowns James VI (r. 1566-1625) was a major patron of the arts in general. In January 1580 the Hudson brothers performed in a masque at Holyrood Palace. The Navigatioun of Alexander Montgomerie was the spoken prologue. The masque involved the torchlit entrance at Holyrood Palace of the narrator and his companions, a \"Turk, the More, and the Egyptien\". The court musicians were bought \"mask claithis\" comprising red and yellow taffeta with swords and daggers. Montgomerie's prologue alludes to the Magi and Epiphany to flatter James VI as the Northern Star, and he was also characterised as Solomon. The masque was followed by dancing. James VI inherited a number of musicians from his mother's court, including James Lauder and members of the Hudson family. Robert Hudson became treasurer of the Chapel Royal in 1587 before retiring to Dunfermline about 1593. Thomas Hudson was an important member of the Castalian Band of poets that gathered around the king and became Master of the Chapel Royal in 1586. William Hudson acted as the young king's dancing master in 1579, indicating that dance music like the pavan and galliards, common in the English Court, had reached Scotland. James Hudson moved on to being an envoy, travelling for the king to London and back. No music can be unequivocally attributed to the family, but several later pieces may be reworkings of their compositions. He also employed trumpeters, and one was given new clothes to serve on the ship, the James that took him to Norway to meet his bride Anne of Denmark. William the English trumpeter was given a similar fine costume and a new trumpet in 1599 and sent to Denmark with a gift of hunting hounds. James and Anne participated in masques at courtiers' weddings, performing and dancing in costume. In 1594 James VI rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling for state occasions like the baptism of his son Henry. He followed the tradition of employing lutenists for his private entertainment. Anne of Denmark employed an English lutenist John Norlie.

Pharyngeal consonants are typically pronounced at two regions of the pharynx, upper and lower. The lower region is epiglottal, so the upper region is often abbreviated as merely 'pharyngeal'. Among widespread speech sounds in the world's languages, the upper pharynx produces a voiceless fricative and a voiced sound that ranges from fricative to (more commonly) approximant, . The epiglottal region produces the plosive as well as sounds that range from fricative to trill, and . Because the latter pair is most often trilled and rarely simply fricative, these consonants have been classified together as simply pharyngeal, and distinguished as plosive, fricative/approximant and trill. No language is known to have a phonemic upper pharyngeal plosive. The Nǁng language (Nǀuu) is claimed to have an upper pharyngeal place of articulation among its click consonants: clicks in Nǁng have a rear closure that is said to vary between uvular or upper pharyngeal, depending on the click type. However, if the place were truly pharyngeal, they could not occur as nasal clicks, which they do. Otherwise upper pharyngeal plosives are only known from disordered speech. They appear for example in the speech of some children with cleft palate, as compensatory backing of stops to avoid nasalizing them The extIPA provides the letter (a small-capital ), to transcribe",

It describes what it says is the first appearance of Jesus to his disciples after Resurrection of Jesus, and in a locked room of a house. Content The original Koine Greek, according to the Textus Receptus, reads: In the King James Version of the Bible it is translated as: Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. The modern World English Bible translates the passage as: When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, \"Peace be to you.\" For a collection of other versions see BibleHub John 20:19 Analysis The account of Jesus' first appearance in the Gospel of John (20:19–23; ) shows similarity to the account in the Gospel of Luke (Luke 24:36), that it happened in Jerusalem in the evening of his resurrection from the dead. Only John mentions that the door was locked, and its \"reason\" (fear of the Jews to persecute them after their leader was executed), but the \"function\" is to show the 'miraculous nature of Jesus' appearance', that the risen Jesus is 'no longer bound by normal space conditions'. The door was not merely shut but locked (Greek perfect verb: , ). The words Peace be with you (, ) is a common traditional Jewish greeting (shalom alekem, or shalom lekom; cf. ) still in use today; repeated in John 20:21 & 26), but here Jesus conveys the peace he previously promised to his disciples (; ), causing the rapid switch of their emotion from \"fear\" (verse 19) to \"joy\" (verse 20) The number of the disciples present is not certain, although Thomas' absence is singled out in verse 24, and Judas Iscariot left, but some other disciples less tightly connected could be present as well.

Activity of the alveolar macrophage is relatively high, because they are located at one of the major boundaries between the body and the outside world. They are responsible for removing particles such as dust or microorganisms from the respiratory surfaces. Alveolar macrophages are frequently seen to contain granules of exogenous material such as particulate carbon that they have picked up from respiratory surfaces. Such black granules may be especially common in smoker's lungs or long-term city dwellers.

        "prompt": "macrophages Function Alveolar macrophages are phagocytes that play a critical role in homeostasis, host defense, and tissue remodeling. Their population density is decisive for these many processes. They are highly adaptive and can release many secretions, to interact with other cells and molecules using several surface receptors. Alveolar macrophages are also involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic and necrotic cells. They need to be selective of the material that is phagocytized to safeguard the normal cells and structures. To combat infection, the phagocytes facilitate many pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to help recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the surface of pathogenic microorganisms. PAMPs all have the common features of being unique to a group of pathogens but invariant in their basic structure; and are essential for pathogenicity (ability of an organism to produce an infectious disease in another organism). Proteins involved in microbial pattern recognition include mannose receptor, complement receptors, DC-SIGN, Toll-like receptors(TLRs), the scavenger receptor, CD14, and Mac-1. PRRs can be divided into three classes: signaling PRRs that activate gene transcriptional mechanisms that lead to cellular activation, endocytic PRRs that function in pathogen binding and phagocytosis, and secreted PRRs that usually function as opsonins or activators of complement. The recognition and clearance of invading microorganisms occurs through both opsonin-dependent and opsonin–independent pathways. The molecular mechanisms facilitating opsonin-dependent phagocytosis are different for specific opsonin/receptor pairs. For example, phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized pathogens occurs through the Fcγ receptors (FcγR), and involves phagocyte extensions around the microbe, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Conversely, complement receptor-mediated pathogen ingestion occurs without observable membrane extensions (particles just sink into the cell) and does not generally results in an inflammatory mediator response. Following internalization, the microbe is enclosed in a vesicular phagosome which then undergoes fusion with primary or secondary lysosomes, forming a phagolysosome. There are various mechanisms that lead to intracellular killing; there are oxidative processes, and others independent of the oxidative metabolism. The former involves the activation of membrane enzyme systems that lead to a stimulation of oxygen uptake (known as the respiratory burst), and its reduction to reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), molecular species that are highly toxic for microorganisms. The enzyme responsible for the elicitation of the respiratory burst is known as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, which is composed of five subunits. One component is a membrane cytochrome made up of two protein subunits, gp91phox and p22phox; the remaining three components are cytosolic-derived proteins: p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox. NADPH oxidase exists in the cytosol of the AM when in a quiescent state; but upon activation, two of its cytosolic components, p47phox and p67phox, have their tyrosine and serine residues phosphorylated, which are then able to mediate translocation of NADPHox to the cytochrome component, gp91phox/p22phox, on the plasma membrane via cytoskeletal elements. Compared to other phagocytes, the respiratory burst in AM is of a greater magnitude. Oxygen-independent microbicidal mechanisms are based on the production of acid, on the secretion of lysozymes, on iron-binding proteins, and on the synthesis of toxic cationic polypeptides.

These organelles contain a myriad of degradative enzymes and antimicrobial peptides that are released into the phagolysosome, such as proteases, nucleases, phosphatases, esterases, lipases, and highly basic peptides. Moreover, macrophages possess a number of nutrient deprivation mechanisms that are used to starve phagocytosed pathogens of essential micronutrients. Certain microorganisms have evolved countermeasures which enable them to evade being destroyed by phagocytes. Although lysosomal-mediated degradation is an efficient means by which to neutralize an infection and prevent colonization, several pathogens parasitize macrophages, exploiting them as a host cell for growth, maintenance and replication. Parasites like Toxoplasma gondii and mycobacteria are able to prevent fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes, thus escaping the harmful action of lysosomal hydrolases. Others avoid lysosomes by leaving the phagocytic vacuole, to reach the cytosolic matrix where their development is unhindered. In these instances, macrophages may be triggered to actively destroy phagocytosed microorganisms by producing a number of highly toxic molecules and inducing deprivational mechanism to starve it. Finally, some microbes have enzymes to detoxify oxygen metabolites formed during the respiratory burst. When insufficient to ward off the threat, alveolar macrophages can release proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to call forth a highly developed network of defensive phagocytic cells responsible for the adaptive immune response. The lungs are especially sensitive and prone to damage, thus to avoid collateral damage to type 1 and type II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages are kept in a quiescent state, producing little inflammatory cytokines and displaying little phagocytic activity, as evidenced by downregulated expression of the phagocytic receptor Macrophage 1 antigen (Mac-1). AMs actively suppress the induction of two of the immunity systems of the body: the adaptive immunity and humoral immunity. The adaptive immunity is suppressed through AM's effects on interstitial dendritic cells, B-cells and T-cells, as these cells are less selective of what they destroy, and often cause unnecessary damage to normal cells. To prevent uncontrolled inflammation in the lower respiratory tract, alveolar macrophages secrete nitric oxide, prostaglandins, interleukin-4 and -10(IL-4, IL-10), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Role of signaling molecules Nitric oxide Nitric oxide (NO) is a major source of immunomodulation in rodents, and is produced by enzyme nitric oxide synthetase type 2 (NOS2) in the alveolar macrophage. NO inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinases involved in production of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, the expression of which is fundamental for T cell proliferation. In humans, however, NOS2 activity has been difficult to verify. There are two explanations for the lack of responsiveness in the promoter of human inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) to NO activation by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) + interferon gamma (IFNγ). The first is that there are various inactivating nucleotide variations in the human counterpart of the enhancer element that regulates LPS/IFNγ induced expression of the mouse NOS2 gene. The second is because of the absence of a nuclear factor in human macrophages that is required for optimum expression of gene NOS2 (LPS-inducible nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel complex). It is assumed that the difficulty in verifying NOS2 is due to a much more tightly controlled expression in human AMs as compared",

In rats, NO inhibits the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-mediated maturation of dendritic cells, and in humans it inhibits the TNF-alpha-mediated maturation of human dendritic cells, through cyclic GMP-dependent mechanisms. NO prolongs the ability of human dendritic cells to internalize antigens at sites of inflammation, therefore modulating the beginning steps leading to antigen-specific immune responses. NO production has been implicated as relevant to the pathology of asthma. People with asthma show an increased expression of iNOS in airway epithelial cells and an increased level of nitric oxide in exhaled air. Prostaglandin endoperoxide 2 (PGE2) Many other immunomodulating factors have been isolated, the most important of which are prostaglandins and cytokines. PGE2 was the first immunomodulator to be derived from macrophages and described. PGE2 functions in amplifying peripheral blood lymphocyte IL-10 transcription and protein production; as well as in deactivating macrophages and T-cells. PGE2 is an immunomodulatory eicosanoid derived from the cell membrane component, arachidonic acid, and is processed in the arachidonic acid cascade: the successive oxygenation and isomerization of arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase and PGE2 synthase enzymes. The regulation of target cells by PGE2 occurs via signaling through four cell membrane-associated G-protein-coupled E-prostanoid (EP) receptors, named EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4. PGE2 inhibits bacterial killing and ROI production by AM by impairing Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis through its ability to stimulate the production of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) effectors via EP2 and EP4 receptors signaling. EP2 and EP4 receptors signal primarily through stimulatory G protein (Gs), increasing adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity and subsequent cAMP formation. cAMP is a second messenger that influences multiple cellular functions via the activation of two downstream effector molecules, protein kinase A (PKA) and the exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac-1 and -2). Epac-1 and PKA are both important factors involved in the inhibition of AM bacterial killing. The effects of PKA results from its ability to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on many cellular proteins, especially transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). cAMP/PKA/CREB axis mediates the inhibition of TNF-alpha release. The killing of phagocytosed bacteria by AMs is dependent upon several distinct microbicidal mechanisms, like the reduced NADPH oxidase-mediated release of ROI. ROI generation by NADPH oxidase is an important bactericidal mechanism after FcR-mediated phagocytosis. PGE2 activates both Gs-coupled EP2 and EP4 receptors by ligation, stimulating cAMP production and subsequent activation of downstream cAMP effectors, PKA and Epac-1; both which in turn impair the phosphorylation and phagosomal membrane translocation of NADPH oxidase component, p47phox, thereby inhibiting the respiratory burst. Interleukin-4 and -10 IL-4 is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a key role in the development of T helper type 2(Th2) cells. IL-4 is important for the differentiation of naïve CD4-T cells into mature Th2 type cells; as well as for Immunoglobulin (Ig) class switching to IgE and IgG4 during the development of immune responses.

IL-4 and IL-10 have both been shown to reduce the production of metalloproteinases (endopeptidases which break down collagen and other extracellular proteins) by human AMs. IL-4 has dual effects upon macrophage biological function, which may be either stimulatory or inhibitory. It enhances MHC class II antigen (extracellular protein complex that interacts exclusively with CD4-T cells as part of the exogenous pathway) and Mac-1(surface receptor as part of innate complement system) expression, thus promoting phagocytosis. IL-4 has also been shown to inhibit the production of PGE2 by reducing the expression of the enzyme, prostaglandin H synthase -2 (PGHS-2), which is critical in the production of PGE2. However, IL-4 inhibits production of TNF-alpha, IL-1 and -6, which are all important cytokines in the proinflammatory response). IL-10 inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and INF-gamma, thus suppressing the proliferation of T-cells, NK cells, and AM. IL-10 shares similar immunomodulating mechanisms to TGF-β. It is thought that both cytokines reduce the rate of apoptosis in human alveolar macrophages, thus indirectly enhancing alveolar macrophage-mediated inhibition of T-cell proliferation. There is a significant increase in the basal rate of apoptosis upon activation by bacterial products. Apoptosis is particularly regulated by the presence of cytokines: IFNγ increases the rate of apoptosis, whereas IL-10 and TGF-β decrease it. However, IL-10 has counterproductive effects on the immune system, and has been shown to actually promote infection by foreign pathogens. The role of IL-10 in bacterial and parasitic infection has been discovered as a strategy to evade host immune systems. There are bacteria which parasitize AMs by invading through their membranes, and thrive by growing and replicating inside of them, exploiting AMs as host cells. Normally, this infection can be eliminated by T-cells, which activate enzymes in alveolar macrophages that destroy the bacteria; but these bacteria have been shown to alter the cytokine signaling network to their advantage. As an inhibitory cytokine, IL-10 facilitates the infection of human alveolar macrophages and monocytes by completely reversing the protective effect of IFNγ against intracellular Legionella pneumophila replication. Yersinia enterocolitica has also been shown to releases virulence antigen LcrV, which induces IL-10 through Toll-like receptor-2 and CD14 (an accessory surface protein of TLR4-mediated LPS-signaling), resulting in the suppression of IFNγ and TNF-alpha suppression. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) In normal conditions, alveolar macrophages adhere closely to alveolar epithelial cells, thus inducing the expression of the αvβ6 integrin. Integrins are dimeric cell-surface receptors composed of alpha and beta subunits, which activates TGF-β.< TGF-β is a multifunctional cytokine that modulates a variety of biological processes such as cell growth, apoptosis, extracellular matrix synthesis, inflammation, and immune responses. TGF-β tightly regulates anti-inflammatory activity by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production, thereby inhibiting T-lymphocyte function. Integrins avβ6 and avβ8 sequester latent TGF-β to the cell surface, where activation can be tightly coupled to cellular responses to environmental stress in the maintenance of homeostasis; integrins also localize",

        "prompt": "TGFβ in the vicinity of the macrophages. Normally mature TGFβ is secreted as a latent complex with its N-terminal fragment, latency-associated peptide (LAP), which inhibits its activity. The latent complex is covalently linked to the extracellular matrix by binding to latent TGF-β-binding proteins. TGF-β is activated by diverse mechanisms in the lung, ultimately involving either proteolysis or conformational alteration of the LAP. αvβ6 integrin is able to mediate activation of TGF-β by binding to TGF-β1 LAP, which serves as a ligand binding site for the integrin, and is an essential component of the TGF-β activation apparatus. Once activated, TGFβ leads to the suppression of macrophage functionality (cytokine production and phagocytosis). Binding of activated TGF-β to its receptors expressed on alveolar macrophages induces a downstream signaling cascade, including phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Small Mothers Against Decapentaplegic (R-SMAD)homologs 2 and 3. Phosphorylated SMAD-2 and -3 then form heteromeric complexes with common-mediator SMAD 4 (co-SMAD-4). Once assembled, the complexes translocates into the nucleus via the nuclear pore with the assistance of importins alpha/beta. Once in the nucleus, these complexes accumulate and eventually act as a transcription factors, regulating the expression of TGF-β target genes. Thus TGF-β signaling involves a direct pathway from the receptors on the surface of a cell to the nucleus. Activation Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are signaling PRRs, capable of recognizing various bacterial proteins. Although bacteria have evolved means of evading host defense mechanisms, they express PAMPs, such as lipoglycans and lipoproteins that are recognized by cells of the innate immune system through the TLRs. Upon binding of PAMPs to TLRs, the TLR triggers inflammatory and defensive responses in the host cell, inducing actin polymerization in alveolar macrophages (a crucial component in endocytosis and motility). Actin polymerization in alveolar macrophages causes the suppression of integrin expression, which in turn causes the deactivation of TGF-β and the downregulation of the basal phosphorylation level of SMAD 2/3; subsequently leading to the activation and detachment of alveolar macrophages from the alveolar epithelial cells [15]. Upon activation, macrophages become primed for phagocytosis and begin to secrete proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6). The priming of macrophages involves the enhancement of respiratory burst activity by IFN-γ and TNF-α. IFNγ induces both an increased affinity of the NADPH oxidase for NADPH in macrophages, as well as an increased rate of gene transcription and message expression for gp91phox protein. TNF-α acts as an autocrine stimulus by increasing the expression of both p47phox and p67phox transcripts. The ROIs produced during the respiration burst response, in turn, enhance production of TNF-α by macrophages. Deactivation Gas exchange must be restored as quickly as possible to avoid collateral damage, so activated lymphocytes secrete IFNγ to stimulate the production of matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 by macrophages. AMs have been reported to produce MMP-9 partly via PGE2-dependent PKA signaling pathways, which are the pathways involved in the inhibition of phagocytosis. MMP-9 activates latent TGF-β, reinducing expression of αvβ6 integrins on alveolar epithelial cells, thereby returning the alveolar macrophage to a resting state. Activation of TGF-β is also advantageous because its production stimulates collagen synthesis in interstitial fibroblasts, which",

She is best known as the wife and supporter of poet, playwright, popular speaker and Nobel laureate Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. Biography Karoline Johanne Elisabeth Reimers was born at Etne in Hordaland and grew up in Bergen, Norway. She was the daughter of Rasmus Helt Reimers (1801–1884) and Marie Jahn (1806–1841). The Reimers and Jahn families had originally immigrated from Germany. She became a student at the Kristiania norske Theater from 1854. In 1858 she was given a role in a play at Det Norske Theater in Bergen, and then joined the theater on a tour to Trondheim. She was married to Bjørnstären Bjørnson from 1858 and to his death in 1910. She was the model for several of Bjørnson's literary women figures, and helping out with articles and other literary works. The figures \"Klara Sang\" and \"Tora Parsberg\" are modelled after her. Several of Bjørnson's poems are dedicated to his wife Karoline. She was the mother of six children, five of whom lived to adulthood: Bjørn Bjørnson (1859–1942) Einar Bjørnson (1864–1942) Erling Bjørnson (1868–1959) Bergliot Ibsen (1869–1953) Dagny Bjørnson (1871–1872) Dagny Bjørnson (1876–1974) She died at Aulestad the family estate in Follebu, Oppland at 98 years old.

While AVC uses the integer discrete cosine transform (DCT) with 4×4 and 8×8 block sizes, HEVC uses both integer DCT and discrete sine transform (DST) with varied block sizes between 4×4 and 32×32. The High Efficiency Image Format (HEIF) is based on HEVC. Concept In most ways, HEVC is an extension of the concepts in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. Both work by comparing different parts of a frame of video to find areas that are redundant, both within a single frame and between consecutive frames. These redundant",

The primary changes for HEVC include the expansion of the pattern comparison and difference-coding areas from 16×16 pixel to sizes up to 64×64, improved variable-block-size segmentation, improved \"intra\" prediction within the same picture, improved motion vector prediction and motion region merging, improved motion compensation filtering, and an additional filtering step called sample-adaptive offset filtering. Effective use of these improvements requires much more signal processing capability for compressing the video, but has less impact on the amount of computation needed for decompression. HEVC was standardized by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC), a collaboration between the ISO/IEC MPEG and ITU-T Study Group 16 VCEG. The ISO/IEC group refers to it as MPEG-H Part 2 and the ITU-T as H.265. The first version of the HEVC standard was ratified in January 2013 and published in June 2013. The second version, with multiview extensions (MV-HEVC), range extensions (RExt), and scalability extensions (SHVC), was completed and approved in 2014 and published in early 2015. Extensions for 3D video (3D-HEVC) were completed in early 2015, and extensions for screen content coding (SCC) were completed in early 2016 and published in early 2017, covering video containing rendered graphics, text, or animation as well as (or instead of) camera-captured video scenes. In October 2017, the standard was recognized by a Primetime Emmy Engineering Award as having had a material effect on the technology of television. HEVC contains technologies covered by patents owned by the organizations that participated in the JCT-VC. Implementing a device or software application that uses HEVC may require a license from HEVC patent holders. The ISO/IEC and ITU require companies that belong to their organizations to offer their patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing (RAND) terms. Patent licenses can be obtained directly from each patent holder, or through patent licensing bodies, such as MPEG LA, Access Advance, and Velos Media. The combined licensing fees currently offered by all of the patent licensing bodies are higher than for AVC. The licensing fees are one of the main reasons HEVC adoption has been low on the web and is why some of the largest tech companies (Amazon, AMD, Apple, ARM, Cisco, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla, Netflix, Nvidia, and more) have joined the Alliance for Open Media, which finalized royalty-free alternative video coding format AV1 on March 28, 2018. History The HEVC format was jointly developed by more than a dozen organisations across the world. The majority of active patent contributions towards the development of the HEVC format came from five organizations: Samsung Electronics (4,249 patents), General Electric (1,127 patents), M&K Holdings (907 patents), NTT ( patents), and JVC Kenwood (628 patents). Other patent holders include Fujitsu, Apple, Canon, Columbia University, KAIST, Kwangwoon University, MIT, Sungkyunkwan University, Funai, Hikvision, KBS, KT and NEC. Previous work In 2004, the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) began a major study of technology advances that could enable creation of a new video compression standard (or substantial compression-oriented enhancements of the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC standard).

In January 2005, at the next meeting of VCEG, VCEG began designating certain topics as \"Key Technical Areas\" (KTA) for further investigation. A software codebase called the KTA codebase was established for evaluating such proposals. The KTA software was based on the Joint Model (JM) reference software that was developed by the MPEG & VCEG Joint Video Team for H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. Additional proposed technologies were integrated into the KTA software and tested in experiment evaluations over the next four years. Two approaches for standardizing enhanced compression technology were considered: either creating a new standard or creating extensions of H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. The project had tentative names H.265 and H.NGVC (Next-generation Video Coding), and was a major part of the work of VCEG until its evolution into the HEVC joint project with MPEG in 2010. The preliminary requirements for NGVC were the capability to have a bit rate reduction of 50% at the same subjective image quality compared with the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC High profile, and computational complexity ranging from 1/2 to 3 times that of the High profile. NGVC would be able to provide 25% bit rate reduction along with 50% reduction in complexity at the same perceived video quality as the High profile, or to provide greater bit rate reduction with somewhat higher complexity. The ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) started a similar project in 2007, tentatively named High-performance Video Coding. An agreement of getting a bit rate reduction of 50% had been decided as the goal of the project by July 2007. Early evaluations were performed with modifications of the KTA reference software encoder developed by VCEG. By July 2009, experimental results showed average bit reduction of around 20% compared with AVC High Profile; these results prompted MPEG to initiate its standardization effort in collaboration with VCEG. Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding MPEG and VCEG established a Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC) to develop the HEVC standard. Standardization A formal joint Call for Proposals on video compression technology was issued in January 2010 by VCEG and MPEG, and proposals were evaluated at the first meeting of the MPEG & VCEG Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC), which took place in April 2010. A total of 27 full proposals were submitted. Evaluations showed that some proposals could reach the same visual quality as AVC at only half the bit rate in many of the test cases, at the cost of 2–10× increase in computational complexity, and some proposals achieved good subjective quality and bit rate results with lower computational complexity than the reference AVC High profile encodings. At that meeting, the name High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) was adopted for the joint project. Starting at that meeting, the JCT-VC integrated features of some of the best proposals into a single software codebase and a \"Test Model under Consideration\", and performed further experiments to evaluate various proposed features. The first working draft specification of HEVC was produced at the third JCT-VC meeting in October 2010. Many changes in",

On January 25, 2013, the ITU announced that HEVC had received first stage approval (consent) in the ITU-T Alternative Approval Process (AAP). On the same day, MPEG announced that HEVC had been promoted to Final Draft International Standard (FDIS) status in the MPEG standardization process. On April 13, 2013, HEVC/H.265 was approved as an ITU-T standard. The standard was formally published by the ITU-T on June 7, 2013, and by the ISO/IEC on November 25, 2013. On July 11, 2014, MPEG announced that the 2nd edition of HEVC will contain three recently completed extensions which are the multiview extensions (MV-HEVC), the range extensions (RExt), and the scalability extensions (SHVC). On October 29, 2014, HEVC/H.265 version 2 was approved as an ITU-T standard. It was then formally published on January 12, 2015. On April 29, 2015, HEVC/H.265 version 3 was approved as an ITU-T standard. On June 3, 2016, HEVC/H.265 version 4 was consented in the ITU-T and was not approved during a vote in October 2016. On December 22, 2016, HEVC/H.265 version 4 was approved as an ITU-T standard. Patent licensing On September 29, 2014, MPEG LA announced their HEVC license which covers the essential patents from 23 companies. The first 100,000 \"devices\" (which includes software implementations) are royalty free, and after that the fee is $0.20 per device up to an annual cap of $25 million. This is significantly more expensive than the fees on AVC, which were $0.10 per device, with the same 100,000 waiver, and an annual cap of $6.5 million. MPEG LA does not charge any fee on the content itself, something they had attempted when initially licensing AVC, but subsequently dropped when content producers refused to pay it. The license has been expanded to include the profiles in version 2 of the HEVC standard. When the MPEG LA terms were announced, commenters noted that a number of prominent patent holders were not part of the group. Among these were AT&T, Microsoft, Nokia, and Motorola. Speculation at the time was that these companies would form their own licensing pool to compete with or add to the MPEG LA pool. Such a group was formally announced on March 26, 2015, as HEVC Advance. The terms, covering 500 essential patents, were announced on July 22, 2015, with rates that depend on the country of sale, type of device, HEVC profile, HEVC extensions, and HEVC optional features. Unlike the MPEG LA terms, HEVC Advance reintroduced license fees on content encoded with HEVC, through a revenue sharing fee. The initial HEVC Advance license had a maximum royalty rate of US$2.60 per device for Region 1 countries and a content royalty rate of 0.5% of the revenue generated from HEVC video services. Region 1 countries in the HEVC Advance license include the United States, Canada, European Union, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and others.

On top of this, HEVC Advance also charged a royalty rate of 0.5% of the revenue generated from video services encoding content in HEVC. When they were announced, there was considerable backlash from industry observers about the \"unreasonable and greedy\" fees on devices, which were about seven times that of the MPEG LA's fees. Added together, a device would require licenses costing $2.80, twenty-eight times as expensive as AVC, as well as license fees on the content. This led to calls for \"content owners [to] band together and agree not to license from HEVC Advance\". Others argued the rates might cause companies to switch to competing standards such as Daala and VP9. On December 18, 2015, HEVC Advance announced changes in the royalty rates. The changes include a reduction in the maximum royalty rate for Region 1 countries to US$2.03 per device, the creation of annual royalty caps, and a waiving of royalties on content that is free to end users. The annual royalty caps for a company is US$40 million for devices, US$5 million for content, and US$2 million for optional features. On February 3, 2016, Technicolor SA announced that they had withdrawn from the HEVC Advance patent pool and would be directly licensing their HEVC patents. HEVC Advance previously listed 12 patents from Technicolor. Technicolor announced that they had rejoined on October 22, 2019. On November 22, 2016, HEVC Advance announced a major initiative, revising their policy to allow software implementations of HEVC to be distributed directly to consumer mobile devices and personal computers royalty free, without requiring a patent license.

Operating system support Coding efficiency The design of most video coding standards is primarily aimed at having the highest coding efficiency. Coding efficiency is the ability to encode video at the lowest possible bit rate while maintaining a certain level of video quality. There are two standard ways to measure the coding efficiency of a video coding standard, which are to use an objective metric, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), or to use subjective assessment of video quality. Subjective assessment of video quality is considered to be the most important way to measure a video coding standard since humans perceive video quality subjectively. HEVC benefits from the use of larger coding tree unit (CTU) sizes. This has been shown in PSNR tests with a HM-8.0 HEVC encoder where it was forced to use progressively smaller CTU sizes. For all test sequences, when compared with a 64×64 CTU size, it was shown that the HEVC bit rate increased by 2.2% when forced to use a 32×32 CTU size, and increased by 11.0% when forced to use a 16×16 CTU size. In the Class A test sequences, where the resolution of the video was 2560×1600, when compared with a 64×64 CTU size, it was shown that the HEVC bit rate increased by 5.7% when forced to use a 32×32 CTU size, and increased by 28.2% when forced to use a 16×16 CTU size.",

The video encoding was done for entertainment applications and twelve different bitrates were made for the nine video test sequences with a HM-8.0 HEVC encoder being used. Of the nine video test sequences, five were at HD resolution, while four were at WVGA (800×480) resolution. The bit rate reductions for HEVC were determined based on PSNR with HEVC having a bit rate reduction of 35.4% compared with H.264/MPEG-4 AVC HP, 63.7% compared with MPEG-4 ASP, 65.1% compared with H.263 HLP, and 70.8% compared with H.262/MPEG-2 MP.

The video encoding was done for entertainment applications and four different bitrates were made for nine video test sequences with a HM-5.0 HEVC encoder being used. The subjective assessment was done at an earlier date than the PSNR comparison and so it used an earlier version of the HEVC encoder that had slightly lower performance. The bit rate reductions were determined based on subjective assessment using mean opinion score values. The overall subjective bitrate reduction for HEVC MP compared with H.264/MPEG-4 AVC HP was 49.3%. École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) did a study to evaluate the subjective video quality of HEVC at resolutions higher than HDTV. The study was done with three videos with resolutions of 3840×1744 at 24 fps, 3840×2048 at 30 fps, and 3840×2160 at 30 fps.

In August, 2016, Netflix published the results of a large-scale study comparing the leading open-source HEVC encoder, x265, with the leading open-source AVC encoder, x264 and the reference VP9 encoder, libvpx. Using their advanced Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) video quality measurement tool, Netflix found that x265 delivered identical quality at bit rates ranging from 35.4% to 53.3% lower than x264, and from 17.8% to 21.8% lower than VP9. Features HEVC was designed to substantially improve coding efficiency compared with H.264/MPEG-4 AVC HP, i.e. to reduce bitrate requirements by half with comparable image quality, at the expense of increased computational complexity. HEVC was designed with the goal of allowing video content to have a data compression ratio of up to 1000:1. Depending on the application requirements, HEVC encoders can trade off computational complexity, compression rate, robustness to errors, and encoding delay time. Two of the key features where HEVC was improved compared with H.264/MPEG-4 AVC was support for higher resolution video and improved parallel processing methods. HEVC is targeted at next-generation HDTV displays and content capture systems which feature progressive scanned frame rates and display resolutions from QVGA (320×240) to 4320p (7680×4320), as well as improved picture quality in terms of noise level, color spaces, and dynamic range. Video coding layer The HEVC video coding layer uses the same \"hybrid\" approach used in all modern video standards, starting from H.261, in that it uses inter-/intra-picture prediction and 2D transform coding. A HEVC encoder first proceeds by splitting a picture into block shaped regions for the first picture, or the first picture of a random access point, which uses intra-picture prediction. Intra-picture prediction is when the prediction of the blocks in the picture is",

    {
        "prompt": "only on the information in that picture. For all other pictures, inter-picture prediction is used, in which prediction information is used from other pictures. After the prediction methods are finished and the picture goes through the loop filters, the final picture representation is stored in the decoded picture buffer. Pictures stored in the decoded picture buffer can be used for the prediction of other pictures. HEVC was designed with the idea that progressive scan video would be used and no coding tools were added specifically for interlaced video. Interlace specific coding tools, such as MBAFF and PAFF, are not supported in HEVC. HEVC instead sends metadata that tells how the interlaced video was sent. Interlaced video may be sent either by coding each frame as a separate picture or by coding each field as a separate picture. For interlaced video HEVC can change between frame coding and field coding using Sequence Adaptive Frame Field (SAFF), which allows the coding mode to be changed for each video sequence. This allows interlaced video to be sent with HEVC without needing special interlaced decoding processes to be added to HEVC decoders. Color spaces The HEVC standard supports color spaces such as generic film, NTSC, PAL, Rec. 601, Rec. 709, Rec. 2020, Rec. 2100, SMPTE 170M, SMPTE 240M, sRGB, sYCC, xvYCC, XYZ, and externally specified color spaces. HEVC supports color encoding representations such as RGB, YCbCr, and YCoCg. Coding tools Coding tree unit HEVC replaces 16×16 pixel macroblocks, which were used with previous standards, with coding tree units (CTUs) which can use larger block structures of up to 64×64 samples and can better sub-partition the picture into variable sized structures. HEVC initially divides the picture into CTUs which can be 64×64, 32×32, or 16×16 with a larger pixel block size usually increasing the coding efficiency. Inverse transforms HEVC specifies four transform units (TUs) sizes of 4×4, 8×8, 16×16, and 32×32 to code the prediction residual. A CTB may be recursively partitioned into 4 or more TUs. TUs use integer basis functions based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT). In addition, 4×4 luma transform blocks that belong to an intra coded region are transformed using an integer transform that is derived from discrete sine transform (DST). This provides a 1% bit rate reduction but was restricted to 4×4 luma transform blocks due to marginal benefits for the other transform cases. Chroma uses the same TU sizes as luma so there is no 2×2 transform for chroma. Parallel processing tools Tiles allow for the picture to be divided into a grid of rectangular regions that can independently be decoded/encoded. The main purpose of tiles is to allow for parallel processing. Tiles can be independently decoded and can even allow for random access to specific regions of a picture in a video stream. Wavefront parallel processing (WPP) is when a slice is divided into rows of CTUs in which the first row is decoded normally but each additional row requires that decisions be made in the previous row. WPP has the entropy encoder use information from the preceding",

        "prompt": "of CTUs and allows for a method of parallel processing that may allow for better compression than tiles. Tiles and WPP are allowed, but are optional. If tiles are present, they must be at least 64 pixels high and 256 pixels wide with a level specific limit on the number of tiles allowed. Slices can, for the most part, be decoded independently from each other with the main purpose of tiles being the re-synchronization in case of data loss in the video stream. Slices can be defined as self-contained in that prediction is not made across slice boundaries. When in-loop filtering is done on a picture though, information across slice boundaries may be required. Slices are CTUs decoded in the order of the raster scan, and different coding types can be used for slices such as I types, P types, or B types. Dependent slices can allow for data related to tiles or WPP to be accessed more quickly by the system than if the entire slice had to be decoded. The main purpose of dependent slices is to allow for low-delay video encoding due to its lower latency. Other coding tools Entropy coding HEVC uses a context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC) algorithm that is fundamentally similar to CABAC in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. CABAC is the only entropy encoder method that is allowed in HEVC while there are two entropy encoder methods allowed by H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. CABAC and the entropy coding of transform coefficients in HEVC were designed for a higher throughput than H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, while maintaining higher compression efficiency for larger transform block sizes relative to simple extensions. For instance, the number of context coded bins have been reduced by 8× and the CABAC bypass-mode has been improved in terms of its design to increase throughput. Another improvement with HEVC is that the dependencies between the coded data has been changed to further increase throughput. Context modeling in HEVC has also been improved so that CABAC can better select a context that increases efficiency when compared with H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. Intra prediction HEVC specifies 33 directional modes for intra prediction compared with the 8 directional modes for intra prediction specified by H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. HEVC also specifies DC intra prediction and planar prediction modes. The DC intra prediction mode generates a mean value by averaging reference samples and can be used for flat surfaces. The planar prediction mode in HEVC supports all block sizes defined in HEVC while the planar prediction mode in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is limited to a block size of 16×16 pixels. The intra prediction modes use data from neighboring prediction blocks that have been previously decoded from within the same picture. Motion compensation For the interpolation of fractional luma sample positions HEVC uses separable application of one-dimensional half-sample interpolation with an 8-tap filter or quarter-sample interpolation with a 7-tap filter while, in comparison, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC uses a two-stage process that first derives values at half-sample positions using separable one-dimensional 6-tap interpolation followed by integer rounding and then applies linear interpolation between values at nearby half-sample positions to generate values at",

    {
        "prompt": "positions. HEVC has improved precision due to the longer interpolation filter and the elimination of the intermediate rounding error. For 4:2:0 video, the chroma samples are interpolated with separable one-dimensional 4-tap filtering to generate eighth-sample precision, while in comparison H.264/MPEG-4 AVC uses only a 2-tap bilinear filter (also with eighth-sample precision). As in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, weighted prediction in HEVC can be used either with uni-prediction (in which a single prediction value is used) or bi-prediction (in which the prediction values from two prediction blocks are combined). Motion vector prediction HEVC defines a signed 16-bit range for both horizontal and vertical motion vectors (MVs). This was added to HEVC at the July 2012 HEVC meeting with the mvLX variables. HEVC horizontal/vertical MVs have a range of −32768 to 32767 which given the quarter pixel precision used by HEVC allows for a MV range of −8192 to 8191.75 luma samples. This compares to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC which allows for a horizontal MV range of −2048 to 2047.75 luma samples and a vertical MV range of −512 to 511.75 luma samples. HEVC allows for two MV modes which are Advanced Motion Vector Prediction (AMVP) and merge mode. AMVP uses data from the reference picture and can also use data from adjacent prediction blocks. The merge mode allows for the MVs to be inherited from neighboring prediction blocks. Merge mode in HEVC is similar to \"skipped\" and \"direct\" motion inference modes in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC but with two improvements. The first improvement is that HEVC uses index information to select one of several available candidates. The second improvement is that HEVC uses information from the reference picture list and reference picture index. Loop filters HEVC specifies two loop filters that are applied sequentially, with the deblocking filter (DBF) applied first and the sample adaptive offset (SAO) filter applied afterwards. Both loop filters are applied in the inter-picture prediction loop, i.e. the filtered image is stored in the decoded picture buffer (DPB) as a reference for inter-picture prediction. Deblocking filter The DBF is similar to the one used by H.264/MPEG-4 AVC but with a simpler design and better support for parallel processing. In HEVC the DBF only applies to a 8×8 sample grid while with H.264/MPEG-4 AVC the DBF applies to a 4×4 sample grid. DBF uses a 8×8 sample grid since it causes no noticeable degradation and significantly improves parallel processing because the DBF no longer causes cascading interactions with other operations. Another change is that HEVC only allows for three DBF strengths of 0 to 2. HEVC also requires that the DBF first apply horizontal filtering for vertical edges to the picture and only after that does it apply vertical filtering for horizontal edges to the picture. This allows for multiple parallel threads to be used for the DBF. Sample adaptive offset The SAO filter is applied after the DBF and is designed to allow for better reconstruction of the original signal amplitudes by applying offsets stored in a lookup table in the bitstream. Per CTB the SAO filter can be disabled or applied in one",

        "prompt": "two modes: edge offset mode or band offset mode. The edge offset mode operates by comparing the value of a sample to two of its eight neighbors using one of four directional gradient patterns. Based on a comparison with these two neighbors, the sample is classified into one of five categories: minimum, maximum, an edge with the sample having the lower value, an edge with the sample having the higher value, or monotonic. For each of the first four categories an offset is applied. The band offset mode applies an offset based on the amplitude of a single sample. A sample is categorized by its amplitude into one of 32 bands (histogram bins). Offsets are specified for four consecutive of the 32 bands, because in flat areas which are prone to banding artifacts, sample amplitudes tend to be clustered in a small range. The SAO filter was designed to increase picture quality, reduce banding artifacts, and reduce ringing artifacts. Range extensions Range extensions in MPEG are additional profiles, levels, and techniques that support needs beyond consumer video playback: Profiles supporting bit depths beyond 10, and differing luma/chroma bit depths. Intra profiles for when file size is much less important than random-access decoding speed. Still Picture profiles, forming the basis of High Efficiency Image File Format, without any limit on the picture size or complexity (level 8.5). Unlike all other levels, no minimum decoder capacity is required, only a best-effort with reasonable fallback. Within these new profiles came enhanced coding features, many of which support efficient screen encoding or high-speed processing: Persistent Rice adaptation, a general optimization of entropy coding. Higher precision weighted prediction at high bit depths. Cross-component prediction, allowing the imperfect YCbCr color decorrelation to let the luma (or G) match set the predicted chroma (or R/B) matches, which results in up to 7% gain for YCbCr 4:4:4 and up to 26% for RGB video. Particularly useful for screen coding. Intra smoothing control, allowing the encoder to turn smoothing on or off per-block, instead of per-frame. Modifications of transform skip: Residual DPCM (RDPCM), allowing more-optimal coding of residual data if possible, vs the typical zig-zag. Block size flexibility, supporting block sizes up to 32×32 (versus only 4×4 transform skip support in version 1). 4×4 rotation, for potential efficiency. Transform skip context, enabling DCT and RDPCM blocks to carry a separate context. Extended precision processing, giving low bit-depth video slightly more accurate decoding.

Profiles Version 1 of the HEVC standard defines three profiles: Main, Main 10, and Main Still Picture. Version 2 of HEVC adds 21 range extensions profiles, two scalable extensions profiles, and one multi-view profile. HEVC also contains provisions for additional profiles. Extensions that were added to HEVC include increased bit depth, 4:2:2/4:4:4 chroma sampling, Multiview Video Coding (MVC), and Scalable Video Coding (SVC). The HEVC range extensions, HEVC scalable extensions, and HEVC multi-view extensions were completed in July 2014. In July 2014 a draft of the second version of HEVC was released. Screen content coding (SCC) extensions were under development for screen content video, which contains text and graphics, with an expected final draft release date of 2015. A profile is a defined set of coding tools that can be used to create a bitstream that conforms to that profile. An encoder for a profile may choose which coding tools to use as long as it generates a conforming bitstream while a decoder for a profile must support all coding tools that can be used in that profile. Version 1 profiles Main The Main profile allows for a bit depth of 8 bits per sample with 4:2:0 chroma sampling, which is the most common type of video used with consumer devices. Main 10 The Main 10 profile was added at the October 2012 HEVC meeting based on proposal JCTVC-K0109 which proposed that a 10-bit profile be added to HEVC for consumer applications. The proposal said this was to allow for improved video quality and to support the Rec. 2020 color space that has become widely used in UHDTV systems and to be able to deliver higher dynamic range and color fidelity avoiding the banding artifacts. A variety of companies supported the proposal which included Ateme, BBC, BSkyB, Cisco, DirecTV, Ericsson, Motorola Mobility, NGCodec, NHK, RAI, ST, SVT, Thomson Video Networks, Technicolor, and ViXS Systems. The Main 10 profile allows for a bit depth of 8 to 10 bits per sample with 4:2:0 chroma sampling. HEVC decoders that conform to the Main 10 profile must be capable of decoding bitstreams made with the following profiles: Main and Main 10. A higher bit depth allows for a greater number of colors. 8 bits per sample allows for 256 shades per primary color (a total of 16.78 million colors) while 10 bits per sample allows for 1024 shades per primary color (a total of 1.07 billion colors).",

The Main 10 profile allows for improved video quality since it can support video with a higher bit depth than what is supported by the Main profile. Additionally, in the Main 10 profile 8-bit video can be coded with a higher bit depth of 10 bits, which allows improved coding efficiency compared to the Main profile. Ericsson said the Main 10 profile would bring the benefits of 10 bits per sample video to consumer TV. They also said that for higher resolutions there is no bit rate penalty for encoding video at 10 bits per sample. Imagination Technologies said that 10-bit per sample video would allow for larger color spaces and is required for the Rec. 2020 color space that will be used by UHDTV. They also said the Rec. 2020 color space would drive the widespread adoption of 10-bit-per-sample video. In a PSNR based performance comparison released in April 2013 the Main 10 profile was compared to the Main profile using a set of 3840×2160 10-bit video sequences. The 10-bit video sequences were converted to 8 bits for the Main profile and remained at 10 bits for the Main 10 profile. The reference PSNR was based on the original 10-bit video sequences. In the performance comparison the Main 10 profile provided a 5% bit rate reduction for inter frame video coding compared to the Main profile. The performance comparison states that for the tested video sequences the Main 10 profile outperformed the Main profile. Main Still Picture The Main Still Picture profile allows for a single still picture to be encoded with the same constraints as the Main profile. As a subset of the Main profile the Main Still Picture profile allows for a bit depth of 8 bits per sample with 4:2:0 chroma sampling. An objective performance comparison was done in April 2012 in which HEVC reduced the average bit rate for images by 56% compared to JPEG. A PSNR based performance comparison for still image compression was done in May 2012 using the HEVC HM 6.0 encoder and the reference software encoders for the other standards. For still images HEVC reduced the average bit rate by 15.8% compared to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, 22.6% compared to JPEG 2000, 30.0% compared to JPEG XR, 31.0% compared to WebP, and 43.0% compared to JPEG. A performance comparison for still image compression was done in January 2013 using the HEVC HM 8.0rc2 encoder, Kakadu version 6.0 for JPEG 2000, and IJG version 6b for JPEG. The performance comparison used PSNR for the objective assessment and mean opinion score (MOS) values for the subjective assessment. The subjective assessment used the same test methodology and images as those used by the JPEG committee when it evaluated JPEG XR. For 4:2:0 chroma sampled images the average bit rate reduction for HEVC compared to JPEG 2000 was 20.26% for PSNR and 30.96% for MOS while compared to JPEG it was 61.63% for PSNR and 43.10% for MOS.

Scalable Main 444 The Scalable Main 4:4:4 profile allows for a base layer that conforms to the Main 4:4:4 profile of HEVC. Tiers and levels The HEVC standard defines two tiers, Main and High, and thirteen levels. A level is a set of constraints for a bitstream. For levels below level 4 only the Main tier is allowed. The Main tier is a lower tier than the High tier. The tiers were made to deal with applications that differ in terms of their maximum bit rate. The Main tier was designed for most applications while the High tier was designed for very demanding applications. A decoder that conforms to a given tier/level is required to be capable of decoding all bitstreams that are encoded for that tier/level and for all lower tiers/levels. The maximum bit rate of the profile is based on the combination of bit depth, chroma sampling, and the type of profile. For bit depth the maximum bit rate increases by 1.5× for 12-bit profiles and 2× for 16-bit profiles. For chroma sampling the maximum bit rate increases by 1.5× for 4:2:2 profiles and 2× for 4:4:4 profiles. For the Intra profiles the maximum bit rate increases by 2×. The maximum frame rate supported by HEVC is 300 fps. The MaxDpbSize is the maximum number of pictures in the decoded picture buffer. Decoded picture buffer Previously decoded pictures are stored in a decoded picture buffer (DPB), and are used by HEVC encoders to form predictions for subsequent pictures. The maximum number of pictures that can be stored in the DPB, called the DPB capacity, is 6 (including the current picture) for all HEVC levels when operating at the maximum picture size supported by the level. The DPB capacity (in units of pictures) increases from 6 to 8, 12, or 16 as the picture size decreases from the maximum picture size supported by the level. The encoder selects which specific pictures are retained in the DPB on a picture-by-picture basis, so the encoder has the flexibility to determine for itself the best way to use the DPB capacity when encoding the video content.

A draft document has been submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force which describes a method to add HEVC support to the Real-time Transport Protocol. Using HEVC's intra frame encoding, a still-image coded format called Better Portable Graphics (BPG) has been proposed by the programmer Fabrice Bellard. It is essentially a wrapper for images coded using the HEVC Main 4:4:4 16 Still Picture profile with up to 14 bits per sample, although it uses an abbreviated header syntax and adds explicit support for Exif, ICC profiles, and XMP metadata. Patent license terms License terms and fees for HEVC patents, compared with its main competitors: Provision for costless software As with its predecessor AVC, software distributors that implement HEVC in products must pay a price per distributed copy. While this licensing model is manageable for paid software, it is an obstacle to most free and open-source software, which is meant to be freely distributable. In the opinion of MulticoreWare, the developer of x265, enabling royalty-free software encoders and decoders is in the interest of accelerating HEVC adoption. HEVC Advance made an exception that specifically waives the royalties on software-only implementations (both decoders and encoders) when not bundled with hardware. However, the exempted software is not free from the licensing obligations of other patent holders (e.g. members of the MPEG LA pool). While the obstacle to free software is no concern in for example TV broadcast networks, this problem, combined with the prospect of future collective lock-in to the format, makes several organizations like Mozilla (see OpenH264) and the Free Software Foundation Europe wary of royalty-bearing formats for internet use. Competing formats intended for internet use (VP9 and AV1) are intended to steer clear of these concerns by being royalty free (provided there are no third-party claims of patent rights). : Regardless of how the software is licensed from the software authors (see software licensing), if what it does is patented, its use remains bound by the patent holders' rights unless the use of the patents has been authorized by a license. Versatile Video Coding In October 2015, MPEG and VCEG formed Joint Video Exploration Team (JVET) to evaluate available compression technologies and study the requirements for a next-generation video compression standard. The new algorithm should have 30–50% better compression rate for the same perceptual quality, with support for lossless and subjectively lossless compression. It should also support YCbCr 4:4:4, 4:2:2 and 4:2:0 with 10 to 16 bits per component, BT.2100 wide color gamut and high dynamic range (HDR) of more than 16 stops (with peak brightness of 1000, 4000 and 10000 nits), auxiliary channels (for depth, transparency, etc.), variable and fractional frame rates from 0 to 120 Hz, scalable video coding for temporal (frame rate), spatial (resolution), SNR, color gamut and dynamic range differences, stereo/multiview coding, panoramic formats, and still picture coding.

History It was built in the old village of Great Stanmore as a parish hall and opened on 8 December 1871 by Lord George Hamilton. Bernays Institute was built as a memorial to Ernest Bernays, eldest son of Reverend Leopold Bernays, who was the rector of Stanmore at the time and chairman of Stanmore Gas Company off Marsh Lane. Ernest died at the age of 22 in a drowning accident on holiday in Ireland on 31 August 1870 - this date is written on the front of the building - he was buried at St John the Evangelist churchyard. The building was built on a plot of glebe land that was sold by Leopold on behalf of the church. In its early years the hall was often used for Bible classes, concerts and was used by the local temperance society. In 1899 it housed a library. That same decade a working men's club opened beside the building which is still open today. In 1959 as reported by the Harrow Observer, Harrow Urban District mayor H.W. Cutler called Bernays Institute \"an awful dump [..] an eyesore in a pleasant district [..] a shack of the worst architectural design\" during a dinner hosted in the institute's honour. Cutler pledged to build a new building in its place. In the 1980s its future became uncertain as schemes for local town centre redevelopment and a shopping complex were made that involved demolishing the hall.

They were similar to the more diverse Plectronocerida and Ellesmerocerida, with short shells, closely-spaced septa, and diaphragms (partitions) within the siphuncle. Their most distinctive trait is the conical shape of the diaphragms, similar to the endocones which characterize the later nautiloid order Endocerida While some authors have argued that Yanhecerida should be lumped into Ellesmerocerida, a phylogenetic analysis has maintained that Yanhecerida is a valid clade of early cephalopods closely related to a paraphyletic Ellesmerocerida (and by extension all post-Cambian cephalopods).

Thoros (together with his father, Leo I and his brother, Roupen) was taken captive and imprisoned in Constantinople in 1137 after the Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus during his campaign against Cilicia and the Principality of Antioch, successfully had laid siege to Gaban and Vahka (currently, Feke in Turkey). All Cilicia remained under Byzantine rule for eight years. Unlike his father and brother, Thoros survived his incarceration in Constantinople and was able to escape in 1143. Whatever the conditions in which Thoros entered Cilicia, he found it occupied by many Greek garrisons. He rallied around him the Armenians in the eastern parts of Cilicia and after a persistent and relentless pursuit of the Greeks, he successfully ousted the Byzantine garrisons from Pardzerpert (now Andırın in Turkey), Vahka, Sis (today Kozan in Turkey), Anazarbus, Adana, Mamistra and eventually Tarsus. His victories were aided by the lack of Muslim attacks in Cilicia and from the setbacks the Greeks and the Crusaders suffered on the heels of the Siege of Edessa in 1144. Emperor Manuel I Comnenus, unhappy with Thoros's progress in the areas still claimed by the Byzantine Empire, sought peaceful means to settle his conflict with Thoros, but his attempts bore him no fruits. The recovery before 1150 of the Taurus fortresses by Thoros had not seriously affected Greek power, but his conquest of Mamistra in 1151 and the rest of Cilicia in 1152 had necessitated a great expedition. As a result, during the course of the next 20 years there were no fewer than three separate military campaigns launched by the emperor against Thoros, but each campaign",

His early years Thoros was the second son of Leo I, lord of Armenian Cilicia. The name and the origin of his mother are not known with certainty. It is possible that she was a daughter of Count Hugh I of Rethel, or she may have been the daughter of Gabriel of Melitene. In 1136, Leo I (Thoros's father) was made prisoner by Baldwin of Marash who sent him off to captivity in Antioch. In his absence, his three sons quarreled; the eldest, Constantine, was eventually captured and blinded by his brothers. After two months of confinement, Leo I obtained his liberty by consenting to harsh terms. In the early summer of 1137, Emperor John II Comnenus came to Cilicia with a full force on his way to take Antioch; his army successively retook Seleucia, Korikos, Tarsus, Mamistra, Adana, Tel Hamdoun (now Toprakkale in Turkey) and Anazarbus. Leo I took refuge in the Taurus Mountains, but at last found the situation hopeless, and surrendered himself to the conqueror; Thoros and his youngest brother, Roupen were also taken captive together with their father. They were dragged away to Constantinople, where Leo I died in imprisonment in 1141. Roupen, after being blinded, was assassinated by the Greeks. His rule The liberation of Armenian Cilicia Thoros escaped from Constantinople about the year 1143; he fled to the island of Cyprus, which was then under Byzantine suzerainty, aboard a Venetian vessel and then found his way to Antioch. He took refuge at the Court of his cousin, Count Joscelin II of Edessa. From there, in the company of a few trusted comrades, he was assisted by a Syrian priest, who led them by night to a safe shelter by the river Pyramus (now Ceyhan River in Turkey). They then crossed the Amanus range (now Nur Mountains in Turkey) and reached the mountainous Armenian strongholds in the Taurus Mountains where Thoros began gathering a new following. He recaptured the family stronghold of Vahka and two of his brothers, Stephen and Mleh joined him. He made friends with a neighboring Frankish lord, Simon of Raban, whose daughter he married. The first Byzantine attack against Cilicia In 1151, while the Byzantines were distracted by the Moslem attack on Turbessel, Thoros swept down into the Cilician plain and defeated and slew the Byzantine governor, Thomas, at the gates of Mamistra. Emperor Manuel I at once sent his cousin Andronicus Comnenus with an army to recover the territory lost to Thoros. But Thoros was well prepared for the unsuspecting Greeks and consequently won a decisive victory at the Battle of Mamistra in 1152. As Andronicus Comnenus moved up to besiege Thoros at Mamistra, the Armenians made a sudden sortie and caught him unawares. His army was routed and he fled back in disgrace to Constantinople. In the meantime, the Hethumids, who were pro-Byzantine sympathizers, did not overlook any opportunity for engaging in an anti-Roupenian armed conflict. Andronicus Comnenus's mission was such",

Among the captives were the two illustrious members, Oshin II of Lampron and his son Hethum. Oshin II was eventually released for a ransom but his son was kept as hostage; but Thoros arranged the marriage of his daughter to Hethum and returned half the ransom money to the groom's father Oshin II of Lampron. Wars with the Seljuks and Antioch Emperor Manuel I Comnenus persuaded the Seljuk sultan of Rûm, Mesud I, to attack Thoros and demand his submission to the Sultan's suzerainty. However, the ensuing Seljuk attack, which in fact was provoked by an Armenian raid into Seljuk lands in Cappadocia in the winter of 1154, was routed successfully by Thoros in collaboration with a contingent of the Knights Templar. Then the emperor turned to Antioch for help; he offered to recognize the new prince, Raynald of Châtillon, if the Franks of Antioch would fight for him against Thoros; he also promised a money-subsidy if the work were properly done. Raynald willingly complied as the Armenians had advanced into the district of Alexandretta (now İskenderun in Turkey) which the Franks claimed as part of the Principality of Antioch. After a short battle near Alexendretta, Raynald drove the Armenian back into Cilicia; and he presented the re-conquered country to the Knights Templar. Other view is that after the battle Raynald was forced to return home, covered with humiliation; and later on, Thoros voluntarily surrendered to the brethren the fortresses in question, and the Knights in turn took oath “to assist the Armenians on all occasions where they needed help.” In 1156, the Jacobites were allowed to build a new cathedral in Antioch, at whose dedication Constance of Antioch and Thoros assisted. Having secured the land that he wanted, Raynald demanded his subsidies from the emperor who refused them, pointing out that the main task had yet to be done. Raynald quickly sided with Thoros and conspired to attack Cyprus; and the Armenians attacked the few remaining Byzantine fortresses in Cilicia. The sack of Cyprus In the spring of 1156, Raynald of Châtillon and Thoros made a sudden landing on Cyprus. Thoros and Raynald both conducted widespread plundering of the island. The Franks and Armenians marched up and down the island robbing and pillaging every building that they saw, churches and convents as well as shops and private houses. The crops were burnt; the herds were rounded up, together with all the population, and driven down to the coast. The nightmare lasted about three weeks; then, on the rumor of an imperial fleet in the offing, Raynald gave the order for re-embarkation. The ships were loaded up with booty; and every Cypriot was forced to ransom himself. In the meantime, Thoros quickly established a friendly rapport with Kilij Arslan II, the new Seljuk sultan of Rûm, and in 1158 a peace treaty was concluded.

There, with a small rapid deployment force of horsemen and Seleucian troops, he launched a surprise attack on Thoros. Thoros was at Tarsus, suspecting nothing, when suddenly, one day in late October, a Latin pilgrim whom he had entertained came rushing back to his Court to tell him that he had seen Imperial troops only a day's march away. Thoros collected his family, his intimate friends and his treasure and fled at once to the mountains. Next day the Emperor Manuel entered the Cilician plain; within a fortnight all the Cilician cities as far as Anazarbus were in his power. But Thoros himself still eluded him. While Byzantine detachments scoured the valleys he fled from hill-top to hill-top and at last found refuge on a crag called Dadjog, near the sources of the river Cydnus; only his two most trusted servants knew where he lay hidden. Thus much of Cilicia was restored back to Byzantine control, but Thoros still held the mountainous regions in the north. Eventually, Baldwin III of Jerusalem intervened and successfully brokered a peace treaty between the emperor and Thoros: Thoros had to walk barefoot and bareheaded to the camp of the emperor; there he prostrated himself in the dust before the imperial platform. The pardon was accorded to him for his transgressions both in Cilicia and Cyprus, and still allowed to hold partial possession in Cilicia.

With the help of a few of his supporters, he continued attacking Greek garrisons thus giving Andronicus Euphorbenus, the Byzantine governor stationed in Tarsus, the opportunity to sabotage the treaty. Stephen was invited to a banquet held in the governor's residence where he was seized upon arrival, and his mutilated corpse was flung over the gates of Tarsus. Thoros, who had his own reasons for desiring Stephen's murder, accused of Andronicus Euphorbenus of complicity and swept down on Mamistra, Anazarbus and Vahka, surprising and murdering the Greek garrisons. Eventually, reconciliation with the emperor was negotiated through the mediation of king Amalric I of Jerusalem. Andronicus Euphorbenus was recalled and replaced by Konstantinos Kalamanos as the new Byzantine governor in Tarsus. In alliance with the crusaders In 1164, when Nur ad-Din, the emir of Aleppo, knew that Amalric I had left for Egypt, he struck at the Principality of Antioch and laid siege to the key fortress of Harenc. Prince Bohemond III of Antioch called upon Count Raymond III of Tripoli, Thoros and Konstantinos Kalamanos to come to his rescue. At the news of their coming, Nur ad-Din raised the siege; as he retired, Bohemond decided to follow in pursuit. The armies made contact on 10 August 1164 at the battle of Harim, near Artah. Ignoring a warning from Thoros, Bohemond attacked at once, and when the Muslims feigned flight rushed headlong after them, only to fall into an ambush. Thoros and his brother",

Around that time (in 1164 or in 1167) Thoros visited Jerusalem and suggested the colonization of a large number of Armenians, but the Latin prelates forced Amalric I to refuse the offer by their insistence that they should pay the dime (a special tax). The third Byzantine attack against Cilicia Intermittent fighting erupted everywhere, harassing the Greek forces throughout Cilicia. In 1168, emperor Manuel I, obsessed with his dilemma with Thoros, marched his armies into Cilicia for the third time under the command of Konstantinos Kalamanos. But Kalamanos was able to produce only limited successes which in the end induced Byzantium to renounce its right of possession of the whole of Cilicia so long as it had access to the ports of the Gulf of Alexandretta. Byzantium also disclaimed all rights to direct government of Cilicia and accepted in settlement only Thoros's recognition of Byzantine suzerainty. His last years Thoros quarreled with his brother Mleh who attempting to assassinate him fled to Nur ed-Din and became a Moslim. Thoros, weary after nearly quarter of a century of rule and warfare, abdicated in favor of his young son Roupen II, who was placed under the guardianship of Thoros's father-in-law, the Regent Thomas.

In June 2006, there were over 500 articulated buses in the United Kingdom, although they were still heavily outnumbered by double deckers. The majority of this fleet was used in London, although these buses would be withdrawn by end of 2011. History Until 1980 articulated buses were illegal for British roads due to their length. Following an exemption, the first trials in the UK used vehicles by MAN and Leyland-DAB. MAN Bendibus, 1979 The first to carry passengers on a scheduled service (albeit without charge, due to regulations) was a MAN Bendibus demonstrator with City of Oxford Motor Services in late 1979. The South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE) purchased ten MANs off lease in 1979, in an order split between MAN and Leyland-DAB articulated buses. Only five of the MANs were delivered and no further orders followed, with the buses returning off lease in 1981. These were the first articulated buses to be purchased by the PTE and the services were branded as the 'Cityliner', painted in a white, green and red livery. Leyland-DAB, 1979 Leyland-DAB articulated buses, built by the British-Danish joint venture, Leyland-DAB bus, in Denmark, were the most intensively trialled first-generation vehicles introduced to the UK. Four models of their National bodied buses were imported, and used on extended trial by South Yorkshire PTE in 1979, returned to the lessor in 1981. These vehicles wore a green, red and cream livery, and while in SYPTE service, were also demonstrated to other UK operators including Maidstone Borough Council Transport. Four examples was also purchased by private London operator Capital Citybus in 1994 from British Airways, receiving route blinds and markings for Red Arrow service. Ultimately, Capital Citybus did not gain the contract, and the Leyland-DABs were never used. Two of these National types were later sold to McGill's Bus Services of Barrhead originally for its Barrhead-Paisley-Renfrew service, and later for its Barrhead-Glasgow service after a weight limit prevented their continued use on the Paisley service, with the others going to Hampshire Bus in Winchester. Some later saw use as airport buses with British Airways, and then as non-PSV exhibit buses (in 2008). Following the trials and demonstrations, no UK operators decided to place orders for the Leyland DABs, except for South Yorkshire Transport in 1985, the bus operating company now divested from the SYPTE. SYT placed an order for 13 buses of the DAB bodied type, ten of which saw service both a blue and cream liveried City Clipper circular service, while three wore branding for the X91 Fastline route. These buses survived privatisation of the passenger transport executives and saw service with the privatised operator Mainline Buses in Sheffield and Rotherham lasting in Mainline service until 1999. One of these buses were loaned for demonstration to London Buses' Selkent division in 1992, operating predominantly on route 180 from Catford garage, having previously been demonstrated with Irish state operator CIÉ.

This bus survived into 2008 as a unique member of the First Aberdeen fleet as fleet number 10046. Modern era Towards the new millennium, interest was revived in the more advanced, lighter, low-floor designs being introduced, and the first second-generation articulated buses were introduced by First Greater Manchester in 1998/1999 on route 135. Articulated buses were first introduced in London in the early 2000s. Later, FirstGroup, in collaboration with Volvo and Wrightbus, developed the Wright StreetCar. FirstGroup branded this the FTR concept, for use in the introduction of new bus rapid transit schemes. The FTR was used in York, Leeds and Swansea. Use of conventional articulated buses has extended beyond London, into the other English regions, as well as Scotland and Wales. Cardiff Bus secured the first Statutory Quality Bus Partnership in the UK which prompted the introduction of high technology artics. While Arriva London had the largest single fleet, in London, First operated the most artics in the UK, across its subsidiary companies. Many articulated buses in operation across the United Kingdom are exiles from London. Use in London The majority of UK articulated buses were based in London, driven by the tendering specification system of Transport for London, the regulation authority responsible for bus services in London. The introduction of articulated buses in London caused several issues, including safety and fare evasion. By 2008, the London fleet stood at 393 buses. In August 2008, following the election of Boris Johnson as Mayor of London, it was announced the articulated buses would be withdrawn as their five-year operating contracts came to an end, starting from May 2009. Route 207 was the last route to operate articulated buses on 10 December 2011. With the main London operators of articulated buses (Arriva and the Go-Ahead Group) also having significant provincial fleets in the UK, many were cascaded to regional fleets. Arriva exported 68 to Malta in 2011 for use by its Arriva in Malta subsidiary. Use in Cardiff In 2006, Cardiff Bus took delivery of 19 articulated Scania OmniCitys. Twelve of these were delivered for use on the Capital City Red services to Ely, which operated to a five-minute frequency, to improve infrastructure and increase capacity on a route previously operated by conventional single deckers, with the aim being that the Ely corridor would become the first Statutory Quality Bus Partnership in Wales. Four OmniCities were allocated to the Baycar service between Cardiff city centre and Cardiff Bay, operating to a ten-minute frequency with the buses delivered in a blue livery. These buses were given a mid-life refurbishment in 2013. Withdrawal and disposal of the articulated OmniCities began in 2020, with four put into storage and two sold to other operators. The Baycar OmniCities were later withdrawn from the service, being reallocated to conventional city routes following a repaint into standard Cardiff Bus livery.

Bristol Airport is a significant operator of articulated Mercedes-Benz Citaros, taking delivery of their first in 2007 and being the first UK operator to order the Euro VI Citaro in 2014. In 2020, 21 new articulated Citaros also entered service at London Stansted Airport.

Most of these were withdrawn in 2020 with the arrival of new Optare MetroDecker EVs for the network, however six were retained and upgraded to Euro VI standard for the Rawcliffe Bar route. Following a successful trial period in 2009, Brighton & Hove first purchased four articulated Citaros from Go-Ahead London in 2010, which were refurbished and put into service for use on routes 25 and 25X serving the University of Brighton. An additional 14 Citaros were later acquired in 2012 to increase capacity on the service. All of Brighton & Hove's 22 Citaros were withdrawn by October 2022 and replaced with former London double-deckers, with the company claiming that discontinued spare parts for the buses, fuel emissions concerns and falling passenger numbers on the university services had led to their withdrawal.

It also can be heard in northern parts of Maryland and parts of southern New York state, as well as parts of eastern Pennsylvania. The daytime-only station previously operated a news/talk format featuring Joy Browne, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, and Sean Hannity. History Originally WMRF, the station signed on in June 1941 with 250 watts on 1490 kHz. The call letters stood for the initials of the last name of the ownership at the time. Just after World War II, Lewistown Broadcasting Company expanded, applying for an FM in Lewistown and an AM and eventually an FM in Altoona, Pennsylvania. In Lewistown, the FM station was granted and constructed as WLTN-FM on 97.9. The transmitter site for WMRF was moved to the WLTN-FM site in Derry Township (Big Ridge) just north of Lewistown to provide for an economical operation as at the time a licensed engineer was required to be on duty when the station was on the air. The FM operation was not financially viable and in 1954 the license was turned back to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In 1964, the FCC came out with a new allocation table, which included 95.9 for Lewistown, Pennsylvania. The company applied and received a grant for 95.9 MHz, which signed on as 100% simulcast of WMRF in 1964. WMRF-FM used the original WLTN-FM building but operated from a 60' telephone pole instead of mounting on the WMRF-FM tower. The old WLTN-FM antenna remained in place until the original tower was dismantled in 1981. In 1980, the tower was replaced with a taller tower to provide better coverage for FM. It also gave WMRF a 5/8 wave tower which had a significant improvement to its coverage. In 1985, the call letters were changed to WIEZ (EZ-1490) as programming on WMRF-FM and WIEZ were now separated. In 1988, WIEZ applied to move to 670 at 5.4 KW daytime and give up the 1490 full-time frequency.

The woodchuck, a word originating from Algonquian \"wejack\", is a kind of marmot, regionally called a groundhog. The complete beginning of the tongue-twister usually goes: \"How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?\" The tongue-twister relies primarily on alliteration to achieve its effects, with five \"w\" sounds interspersed among five \"ch\" sounds, as well as 6 \"ood\" sounds. Answers A traditional, if nonsensical, \"response\" to the question is: \"A woodchuck would chuck as much wood as a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood\". Other — similarly unhelpful — responses include \"So much wood would a woodchuck chuck as a woodchuck would if a woodchuck could chuck wood!\", \"He would chuck, he would, as much as he could, and chuck as much wood as a woodchuck would if a woodchuck could chuck wood.\", and \"As much wood as a woodchuck would if a woodchuck could chuck wood!\" A 1957 Associated Press piece refers to the question as \"a riddle which beats the Sphinx, since it's still unanswered\". A more concrete answer was published by the Associated Press in 1988, which reported that a New York fish and wildlife technician named Richard Thomas had calculated the volume of dirt in a typical long woodchuck burrow and had determined that if the woodchuck had moved an equivalent volume of wood, it could move \"about on a good day, with the wind at his back\". Another study, which considered \"chuck\" to be the opposite of upchucking, determined that a woodchuck could ingest of wood per day. Origin The origin of the phrase is from a 1902 song \"The Woodchuck Song\", written by Robert Hobart Davis for Fay Templeton in the musical The Runaways. The lyrics became better known in a 1904 version of the song written by Theodore Morse, with a chorus of \"How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?\", which was recorded by Ragtime Roberts, in 1904. The tongue-twister is documented as \"folklore\" in 1972 at Farmington, Michigan. It is used in the title of Werner Herzog's 1976 film How Much Wood Would a Woodchuck Chuck, a documentation of the World Livestock Auctioneer Championship in New Holland, Pennsylvania. Popular culture Google features this tongue twister as an Easter egg in its search engine, as well as Google Now. Several other virtual assistants, including Siri and Cortana, have their own unique, humorous responses to the phrase.

The book attempts to address the ontology of quantum objects, their attributes, and their interactions, without reliance on advanced mathematical concepts. Herbert discusses the most common interpretations of quantum mechanics and their consequences in turn, highlighting the conceptual advantages and drawbacks of each. Synopsis Background Following a brief summary of the experimental crises (such as the ultraviolet catastrophe) which motivated quantum theory, Herbert identifies four major formulations of quantum theory: Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, Erwin Schrödinger's wave mechanics, Paul Dirac's transformation theory, and Richard Feynman's sum-over-histories formulation. In introducing quantum objects (which he dubs \"quons\"), Herbert describes how quantum properties inhere in a wave function, which",

        "prompt": "as a proxy for the measurement of these properties. He likens the quantum measurement process to mathematically treating the wave function as a summation of waveforms of a particular family, with various families corresponding to particular properties. The bandwidth of the spectrum of these waveforms represents the uncertainty in the quantum measurement. Herbert shows that for pairs of conjugate variables, such as position and momentum, these bandwidths are linked such that their product has a finite lower bound, thereby illustrating the basis of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: any single property can be measured to arbitrary precision, but conjugate properties cannot simultaneously be known to arbitrary precision. Herbert identifies two philosophical problems presented by quantum theory—the interpretation question, concerning the physical nature of the reality underlying observation; and the measurement problem, concerning the apparently special role of the measurement act in quantum theory, and various approaches to formally defining the measurement act. Eight interpretations Herbert identifies eight interpretations of quantum mechanics, all consistent with observation and with the aforementioned mathematical formalisms. He likens these different interpretations to the story of the blind men and an elephant—different approaches to the same underlying reality, which yield remarkably different (but often overlapping) pictures. The interpretations identified by Herbert are: The Copenhagen interpretation, Part I (\"There is no deep reality.\") Most notably associated with Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, Herbert identifies this as the most broadly accepted interpretation among physicists. In this interpretation, dynamic attributes do not describe the reality of quantum objects themselves, but inhere instead in the relationship between the observed object and the measurement device. The Copenhagen interpretation, Part II (\"Reality is created by observation.\") In this variation of the Copenhagen interpretation, associated with John Archibald Wheeler, the reality of quantum attributes is created in the act of observation, as illustrated by the example of Wheeler's delayed choice experiment. \"Reality is an undivided wholeness.\" This interpretation, associated with David Bohm and Walter Heitler, suggests that the state of the entire universe may be implicated in any quantum measurement. Herbert highlights the apparent interaction of widely separated entangled particles, which may be represented by a single combined wave function, or \"shared reality\", in a high-dimensional configuration space. The many-worlds interpretation. Devised by Hugh Everett, this interpretation does away with the conceptual problem of wave function collapse by supposing that all possible outcomes occur equally, in a constantly branching tree of parallel universes. Quantum logic (\"The world obeys a non-human kind of reasoning.\") Associated with John von Neumann, Garrett Birkhoff, and David Finkelstein, this interpretation holds that quantum objects do possess innate attributes, but that the relationships between these attributes are governed by a non-distributive lattice, or \"wave logic\", unlike the Boolean lattice governing classical objects. In the example of the \"three-polarizer paradox\", two stacked, orthogonally-oriented polarizers will not allow any light to pass through (the meet of the sets of photons which will pass through each filter is null), yet the insertion of a diagonally-oriented polarizer between them allows some light to pass through the stack. The paradox can be understood by considering a polarized",

Neorealism (\"The world is made of ordinary objects.\") Constructed by David Bohm and also associated with Louis de Broglie, this interpretation holds that quantum objects possess definite attributes, but that these attributes can change value instantly in response to events anywhere in the universe, with this information encoded in a physical pilot wave which must be able to travel faster than light. Other physicists attempted to construct object-based models which did away with this superluminal communication, but Bell's theorem later proved this to be impossible. For this reason, according to Herbert, neorealism is rejected by most of the physics establishment. \"Consciousness creates reality.\" First proposed by John von Neumann, this interpretation grants special status to conscious minds as the location of wave function collapse, in which the myriad possibilities of a quantum system are narrowed to one observed state. Unlike the Copenhagen interpretation, in which the observer selects which attribute will be seen to have a definite value but does not determine the value itself, von Neumann contended that the actual attribute value is determined in a collapse that occurs at the interface of the brain and the mind. \"The duplex world of Werner Heisenberg.\" Heisenberg recognized a division inherent in the Copenhagen interpretation, between the concrete actuality (phenomenon) of observations and the range of potentiality (noumenon) described by the wave function. In seeking to address the ontological nature of the unobserved world, he considered quantum theory to be not merely a successful mathematical analogy, but a literal description of the underlying reality. In Herbert's description of Heisenberg's view, the unobserved world is a world composed of possibility, qualitatively less real than the world of observed fact. Bell's theorem and its implications Adding a further wrinkle to the nature of quantum reality, Herbert presents the EPR paradox, and its resolution in the form of Bell's theorem. The EPR paradox, resting on the long-held assumption of locality, suggests the existence of \"elements of reality\"—unmeasured quantum attributes which are nonetheless real—which are not predicted by quantum theory. Bell's theorem resolves this paradox by proving that locality is ruled out by observation—that any model of reality consistent with observation must allow for non-local interaction. However, Herbert is careful to note, Bell's theorem does not entail any prediction of experimentally observable non-local phenomena, nor does it allow for superluminal communication. Herbert then re-evaluates the aforementioned interpretations of quantum reality in light of Bell's theorem: In the case of the Copenhagen interpretation, the \"experimental arrangement\" of observed entity and measurement device in which quantum attributes reside—considered by Bohr to be limited to the local interaction—must be expanded to include potentially distant objects with which these systems may be entangled. According to Herbert, Bell's theorem supports the Bohmian notion of underlying reality as an undivided wholeness. Although Herbert asserts that the many-worlds interpretation lacks the counterfactual definiteness required to prove Bell's theorem, he contends that the many-worlds view is inherently non-local, by any reasonable conception of locality. In Herbert's view, Bell's result strikes a major blow to neorealist",

Reception In its review of Quantum Reality, The New York Times praised Herbert's efforts at making the subject matter comprehensible to a lay audience. Physicist Heinz Pagels called Quantum Reality \"a great place for the general reader to begin to learn about quantum physics\". Kirkus Reviews, however, concluded that Quantum Reality, while engaging, may leave lay readers confused. Post-anarchist writer Hakim Bey used Quantum Reality as the basis for an analysis of the field of quantum physics in terms of the social paradigms that it may influence, and from which it may draw its metaphors.

Lutfur Rahman was again elected as Mayor in the 2022 London Borough elections, beating incumbent Labour Mayor John Biggs. The council was created by the London Government Act 1963 and replaced three local authorities: Bethnal Green Metropolitan Borough Council, Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council and Stepney Metropolitan Borough Council. History There have previously been a number of local authorities responsible for the Tower Hamlets area. The current local authority was first elected in 1964, a year before formally coming into its powers and prior to the creation of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets on 1 April 1965. Tower Hamlets London Borough Council replaced Bethnal Green Metropolitan Borough Council, Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council and Stepney Metropolitan Borough Council. All three had been created in 1900, in Bethnal Green the borough council replaced the parish vestry and in Poplar the council replaced the board of works; both authorities had been incorporated by the Metropolis Management Act 1855. Stepney had a more convoluted history with the metropolitan borough council established in 1900 replacing the Limehouse District Board of Works, the Whitechapel District Board of Works and the parish vestries of Mile End Old Town and St George in the East. It was envisaged that through the London Government Act 1963 Tower Hamlets as a London local authority would share power with the Greater London Council. The split of powers and functions meant that the Greater London Council was responsible for \"wide area\" services such as fire, ambulance, flood prevention, and refuse disposal; with the local authorities responsible for \"personal\" services such as social care, libraries, cemeteries and refuse collection. This arrangement lasted until 1986 when Tower Hamlets London Borough Council gained responsibility for some services that had been provided by the Greater London Council, such as waste disposal. Tower Hamlets became an education authority in 1990. Since 2000 the Greater London Authority has taken some responsibility for highways and planning control from the council, but within the English local government system the council remains a \"most purpose\" authority in terms of the available range of powers and functions. In September 2008, Tower Hamlets London Borough Council named two tower blocks in Sidney Street Peter House and Painter House, even though Peter the Painter was only involved in a minor capacity in the robbery, was not present at the siege of Sidney Street, and may not have existed at all. A local councillor and the Metropolitan Police Federation protested against this, saying that he should not be honoured. Following a local referendum on 6 May 2010, a directly elected executive mayor system of local government commenced with the election on 21 October 2010 of Lutfur Rahman as mayor.

The staff member also claimed that the official cancellation announcement was pre-written by higher-level staff at Electronic Arts. Gameplay Previously, Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight drastically changed the original game's formula in certain areas, such as the removal of base building and the addition of population caps (changes which were poorly received). Command & Conquer (2013) would have returned to its original roots. Along with classic staples such as base building and resource collection, there would have been the usual amounts of orchestrating and commanding large armies. The game would have also introduced oil and natural gas (or coal) as primary resources, as well as \"base proxy\" tactic in which one faction must have \"captured\" a resource stash before letting its harvesters in. Factions The game would have featured three unique factions: European Union (EU), Global Liberation Army (GLA) and Asia-Pacific Alliance (APA). A downloadable campaign was planned to be released for each of them, excluding the tutorial, which would have been free.

After the United States lost much of its global influence and adopted an isolationist policy, China became the dominant world power as it strengthened its military power and sought closer relations with the European Union. They would come together to form the Eurasian Unity League to replace the US-led NATO. However, as relations between China and the EU worsened, the Eurasian Unity League dissolved. China, along with multiple East Asian nations form the Asia-Pacific Alliance, which soon became a global superpower. Meanwhile, the EU, determined not to be dictated to by any foreign power, unified the militaries of its member states and began rapidly expanding and militarising. Soon, the EU became the most technologically powerful faction in the world, replacing the declining United States. As the EU continued to rise as a superpower, further straining relations between the EU and China, leading to the fragmentation and eventual dissolution of the League. Furthermore, their expansionist agenda has led to nations becoming EU satellites and dictators having the backing of the EU, with the China-dominated APA becoming increasingly concerned by the EU's policies.

Development As Generals 2 After the release of Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight, much of the Command & Conquer team, within EA Los Angeles, was laid off in 2010 causing the future of the series to be cast in doubt. In October, a senior vice-president from Electronic Arts had told the media that the Command & Conquer series would live on as a brand from Dead Space developers, Visceral Games, with a title from the series to be released by that developer being \"far-off\" and whether or not he was referring to this game is not clear. The first official announcement of a new Command & Conquer game in development, came in February 2011 when Electronic Arts revealed the formation of a new studio known as Victory Games. In the studios' first Q&A session with the official Command & Conquer blog, openly said that they were developing a new title in the Command & Conquer series with the studios' general focus being on the future of the series. The new studio consisted of members from the previous EA Los Angeles development team as well as some new staff members. Its general manager was Jon Van Caneghem from Trion Worlds. The game's formal announcement was then teased as a game from the \"next big BioWare franchise\" and was due for a revealing at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards. The game was then speculated to be either a new game from defunct studio, Pandemic's Mercenaries series, or a new game from the Command & Conquer series, which turned out to be an accurate analysis. Subsequently, more rumors began to indicate that the game was indeed a Command & Conquer game called, Command & Conquer: Alliances due to a series of domain registrations by EA for a game of that name, though this turned out to be a side project by Phenomic, called Command & Conquer: Tiberium Alliances. The game was finally formally unveiled as Command & Conquer: Generals 2 on December 10 at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards as a title developed by what would become BioWare Victory. However, in November 2012, the BioWare label was dropped and the studio was renamed to its former name Victory Games. Change to free-to-play model In August 2012, Generals 2 was repurposed to a free-to-play game known as simply Command & Conquer. The content which has been built for Generals 2 was to be delivered into the new C&C game. Following the negative reaction from series fans that Command & Conquer would not have a single-player campaign, EA President Frank Gibeau said that a single-player storyline would still be a possibility: \"The beauty of free-to-play is that we can adjust and adapt to what we're hearing as opposed to, 'I'm sorry, it's two months from ship and it is what it is'. It's a very different model because you don't have to build as much. You",

Promotion and cancellation From then on, news of the upcoming game was relatively quiet. In mid-December 2012, Victory Games hosted a C&C Community Summit where select members were invited and given the chance to play the game and share feedback with the developers. It was later on that Victory Games announced the third faction as the Asian-Pacific Alliance. In May EA released a development video diary stating the developers' intention to constantly improve on the final product based on the players' feedback. At E3 2013, EA released a new trailer of the game as well as the beta going live in the summer. On August 5, a second development video diary was released showing the design process of modifying the GLA Bomb Truck unit from Command & Conquer: Generals into the GLA Nuke Truck. Victory Games also released wallpapers of the generals of each faction, starting with the APA generals and later the EU and GLA within a few days of each other. Both EA and Victory Games stated that Command and Conquer would be showcased at Cologne's Gamescom 2013. In addition to the press conference, a trailer revealed that campaign missions were to be made available next year. The game has been canceled as of October 29, 2013 due to negative fan feedback over an economy-based, multiplayer experience. The cancellation statement released by the company cited multiplayer for Command & Conquer being its downfall. Potential reinstation In November 2013, EA said the game will still be developed by a new game studio, and customers who bought the Command & Conquer Ultimate Collection will still receive an invite to the beta. In 2014, EA was looking for a new developer of the reboot No information relating to the game has since been released.

Jack Brabham drove it to his second World Championship that year, and with teammate Bruce McLaren gave Cooper its second Constructors' Championship. Design and development history The T53 was lower and slimmer than its predecessor, the Cooper T51. It was equipped with a new tubular steel frame clad in aluminium panels. Suspension was by double wishbones, coil springs and telescopic dampers all round, a change from Cooper's usual transverse leaf spring at the rear. Power came from the latest version of 2.5 litre Climax FPF which developed around 240 bhp and drove the rear wheels through a Cooper five-speed gearbox. Racing history In",

McLaren was runner-up, and Cooper won the Constructors' Championship. Brabham also won the non-championship Silver City Trophy. In 1961 Cooper turned to the T55 but the T53 became a big sales success for the Cooper team, with no less than eight teams running it. Most teams ran the car with the 1.5 litre Climax FPF Mk.

Although they had some success in non-championship events, the privateers were largely outclassed in the 1961 World Championship. The T53 was also used by various teams in the short-lived Intercontinental Formula in 1961.

The most recent franchise was revived on August 15, 1996. In 2007, the team relocated to Mississauga, Ontario and became the Mississauga St. Michael's Majors until 2012. The hockey program was founded and operated by St. Michael's College School in 1906, and adopted the name \"Majors\" in 1934, and was commonly referred to as St. Mike's Majors. History The St. Michael's College Hockey Team was established in 1906 when the team joined the junior division of the Ontario Hockey Association. The team was not known as the St. Michael's Majors until 1934, and also had the informal nickname of the \"Irish\". The school team played for 55 years until 1961 before suspending operations. St. Michael's revived the Majors (Junior A Tier I) hockey team for the 1997–98 season in the Ontario Hockey League. In total, over one hundred St. Michael's Majors alumni have gone on to play in the National Hockey League, including 13 members of the Hockey Hall of Fame. Early years, Allan Cup 1910 The hockey team was founded and operated by St. Michael's College School, a Catholic secondary school in uptown Toronto. The college's hockey team soon blossomed, as demand for a Catholic program was high. The school competed with their crosstown rivals, the Protestant organized Toronto Marlborough Athletic Club for Toronto's hockey supremacy.

Four years after the hockey program started, St. Michael's were Canadian Amateur Champions, winning the Allan Cup in 1910. Birth of the Majors In 1933, the Ontario Hockey Association's Junior division, split into 'A' and 'B' levels. St. Michael's also divided its hockey program into two teams accordingly. The Junior 'A' team became the Majors, the Junior 'B' team was known as St. Michael's Buzzers. Memorial Cup 1934 The Majors dominated the Junior A hockey scene during the 1933–34 season. The team was undefeated in the regular season, and kept rolling through the playoffs, the Ontario Championship, Eastern Canadian Championship and the Memorial Cup. Also of note, in 1933-34 the Buzzers won the Sutherland Cup as Ontario Junior 'B' champions. St. Michael's featured the likes of Bobby Bauer, Reg Hamilton, Art Jackson, Regis (Pep) Kelly, Nick Metz, Don Wilson, Mickey Drouillard, goaltenders Harvey Teno and Jack Hamilton. The Toronto team was coached by Dr. W. J. (Jerry) Laflamme, a dentist who had quite a hockey history. He refereed in the NHL in the 1920s. That was after he had played defence on the Allan Cup winners from St. Michael's in 1909-1910 and captained the Allan Cup-winning Dentals of Toronto in 1916–17. In the 1934 playoffs St. Michael's skated to 8–2, and 9-3 victories versus the Ottawa Shamrocks to win the two-game series for the Ontario title. In the following series, Toronto faced the Charlottetown Abegweits in the eastern final, played in Toronto. The Majors prevailed again in two games, by scores of 12-2 and 7–2. The Memorial Cup final was played at Shea's Amphitheatre in Winnipeg, where St. Michael's faced the Edmonton Athletic Club in a best-of-three series for the title. The Majors picked up Turk Broda from the Winnipeg Monarchs to back up if goaltender Harvey Teno was injured. St. Mike's opened with a 5–0 victory over the Athletics on April 3. More than 4,500 fans showed up for game 2 on April 5. St. Michael's won its first Memorial Cup championship, with a 6–4 victory in overtime. 1937 OHA Champions St. Michael's made their second trip to the OHA finals in 1937, and again faced the same opponent from in 1934, the Stratford Midgets. Toronto prevailed winning 3 games to 2. In the Ontario Championship, St. Michael's faced a familiar foe in the Copper Cliff Redmen. The Redmen previously played in Newmarket in the same league as Toronto, but switched to NOHA. Toronto lost to the northern Ontario champions, in 2 straight games. Memorial Cup 1945 Joe Primeau returned to coach the 1945 Memorial Cup St. Michael's team, after being runners-up in the OHA finals in 1944. In 1945, Toronto won the J. Ross Robertson Cup, defeating the Galt Black Hawks in four games straight. The Majors advanced further by eliminating the Montreal Royals in six games in the eastern final.

The Majors won each of the next three games by scores of 6–3, 4-3 and 7–2 in the deciding game. Trail, B.C. native Frank Turik scored three hat tricks in the five games to become the tournament's leading goal scorer. Paid attendance for the five games was 65,437, which exceeded the Maple Leaf Gardens junior record for five games (59,301) that had been set in 1943 when the Winnipeg Rangers tangled with the Oshawa Generals. That 1943 series still held the six-game record of 73,867. Memorial Cup 1946 St. Michael's returned to the Memorial Cup for a second consecutive year in 1946. The Majors defeated the Oshawa Generals in a six-game, coming back from two games behind for the OHA championship. St. Michael's then swept the Montreal Junior Canadiens in three games straight in the eastern finals. The Majors met up with the Winnipeg Monarchs at Maple Leaf Gardens on April 13 to start the best-of-seven series for the national championship. Winnipeg won the first game 3 to 2, then Toronto rallied to win the next two games 5 to 3, and 7 to 3, before the Monarchs even the series in game four, winning 4 to 3. Toronto scored a 7 to 4 victory in game five, needing only one more win to be the second team to repeat as Memorial Cup champions. Winnipeg spoiled the plans, winning consecutive 4 to 2 victories to take the cup back west in 1946. Memorial Cup 1947 The 1947 cup would be a rematch of the 1945 Memorial Cup final versus the Moose Jaw Canucks. This series however, was not played at Maple Leaf Gardens, but rather played in Winnipeg, Moose Jaw and Regina. On the road to their third consecutive Memorial Cup appearance, St. Michael's repeated their sweep of the Galt Black Hawks in the OHA finals from two 1945, and the previous year's sweep on the Montreal Jr. Canadiens in the eastern finals. The Memorial Cup's best-of-seven final opened in Winnipeg on April 15 with Toronto hammering Moose Jaw 12 to 3.

Game three was played in Regina, which Toronto kept up its momentum, winning 8 to 1. Game three ended with seven minutes to play in the third period, when the ice was littered for a second time with broken bottles thrown from the stands.

Bob Goldham resigned as head coach of the Majors in 1960, and Father David Bauer took over as head coach for the 1960–61 OHA season in addition to his role as general manager. He stressed fundamentals of defensive play without the puck and taught players how to absorb contact without getting hurt. He occasionally had his players switch positions with one another to learn an appreciation of their teammate's contributions. The Majors finished in second place during the season, then defeated the Guelph Royals in the playoffs for the OHA championship. The Majors won the Eastern Canada final defeating the Moncton Beavers then travelled to Edmonton to play in the 1961 Memorial Cup. The Majors defeated the Edmonton Oil Kings in six games and won the school's fourth Memorial Cup. Majors cease operations The Basilian fathers again discussed the length of the season and the amount of travel having an effect on academics. They were also concerned with increasing physical play and growing similarities with professional leagues. The Majors had played 98 games including the regular season and playoffs for the Memorial Cup. St. Michael's could no longer justify participation in the top tier of the OHA and chose to withdraw from the Ontario Hockey Association Junior A series. Bauer stated in a 1987 interview that, \"We regretted very much leaving because we knew that this [school] is a major recreational institution in this country\". After the official announcement on June 6, 1961, Bauer placed his protégé Jim Gregory in charge of the team. The Majors operated for one more season and played a shortened 33-game schedule in the Metro Junior A League for the 1961–62 OHA season. The team was transferred to Neil McNeil High School and became known as the Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons in 1962. Conn Smythe and the Toronto Maple Leafs wanted to keep the St. Michael's team in operation as a source of players, and then created the Metro Junior A League to help alleviate the college's concerns. The St. Michael's team finished in first place in the Metro Junior A league, and competed for the J. Ross Robertson Cup again in 1962. Coached by Ted Flanagan, the team lost in the Cup finals to the Hamilton Red Wings. Despite being the league champions in the 1961–62 season, St. Michael's discontinued its program altogether, and the team was relocated to Neil McNeil Catholic Secondary School in Scarborough, Ontario, becoming the Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons. Father Bauer chose to pursue building a university-educated Canadian National Team instead. Modern era The modern era of the St. Michael's Majors began on August 15, 1996, when the college was admitted to the OHL as an expansion team.

Melnyk pursued several deals to get a new arena for his team, but none came to fruition. One of Melnyk's foiled plans included purchasing Maple Leaf Gardens. The revived Majors struggled on the ice, and missed the playoffs in each of their first three seasons. During their second season, the Majors started strong, but traded four of their best players (Sheldon Keefe, Mike Jefferson, Ryan Barnes and Shawn Cation) to the Barrie Colts midway through the season, as a result of controversy surrounding David Frost. The Majors made breakthroughs in their fourth season. Toronto reached the conference finals four consecutive years from 2001 to 2004. Their closest point to reaching the league finals was in 2003, leading 3 games to 2 versus the Ottawa 67's and losing game six on home ice in overtime. The Majors played on the smallest ice surface in the OHL, which tended to have a higher average of shots on goal per game than other arenas. Fittingly, the Majors produced several noted goaltenders in their recent history, including Peter Budaj, Andy Chiodo and Justin Peters. The Majors had strong rivalries with the Mississauga IceDogs and Brampton Battalion, both of which are local Greater Toronto Area teams who came into the OHL within a year of the Majors. On July 12, 2006, Eugene Melnyk bought the Mississauga IceDogs. After the 2006–07 season, Melnyk sold the IceDogs, and moved the Majors to the Hershey Centre in Mississauga.

Arenas The St. Michael's Majors play at the school-owned St. Michael's College School Arena. The arena is located in uptown Toronto near the intersection of Bathurst Street and St. Clair Avenue behind St. Michael's College School. The college arena is by far the smallest in the Ontario Hockey League in terms of both ice size and seating. The arena is also home to the St. Michael's Buzzers of the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League. The St. Michael's Majors played at Maple Leaf Gardens for their first three seasons from 1997 to 2000. The original Majors had played at Maple Leaf Gardens from its construction in 1931 to their folding in the early 1960s. When the Gardens was scheduled to close a year after the last Toronto Maple Leafs game, Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment evicted the Majors, who moved to the arena on the college campus. The major junior team had only played there rarely before. The Majors also played selected home games during the 1999–00 season at the Air Canada Centre vs the Mississauga IceDogs and Brampton Battalion, and also an inter-league game versus the Montreal Rocket. In 2003-04 and 2006–07 seasons, the Majors played two home games vs the Ottawa 67's at Scotiabank Place in Kanata, Ontario. This arose from the common ownership between the St. Michael's Majors and the Ottawa Senators by Eugene Melnyk. The Mississauga St. Michael's Majors played home games at the Hershey Centre in northeast Mississauga, near the junction of Highway 401 & Highway 403. The Hershey Centre hosted the OHL All-Star Game in 2000. The arena also hosted the 2011 Memorial Cup from May 19–29. Coaches List of modern era coaches with multiple seasons in parentheses.

He prepares to be interviewed on television by Rafer Johnson afterward, told that he will be asked questions like what got him into running. He flashes back to his childhood. As a 12-year-old suffering from chronic bedwetting, John wakes up early every day to change his soiled sheets and pajamas before his parents can see, running them down to the laundromat on the way to school. His supportive father, Arnold, had promised him a regular bed to replace his child-sized bed if he can stay dry until his next birthday days later. John’s mother Alice is shrill and strident, accusing him of either being too lazy to get out of bed at night to urinate or being spiteful against her. Pretty Nancy Rizzi, a new classmate and next door neighbor, takes an interest in John and they walk home together. They plan to be study partners. John’s father offers to drive him down to a football game early Saturday morning to watch John play with his team. John wakes up even earlier than normal to wash his sheets but finds the laundromat is still closed at that hour. After a resounding victory, Arnold proudly drives John and his teammates home. As they pull up, everybody sees John’s soiled sheet, which his mother had found and hung out of his bedroom window to humiliate him. John’s friends make excuses and walk home. With Alice goading him, Arnold decides to scold John. An embarrassed John tells his friends a story that he had picked up a stray puppy that wet his bed but they seem unconvinced. Nancy offers to walk home with him after football practice, but John races home alone to pull in his sheet so she won’t see it. He tells his parents that he’s quitting the football team because he lost his gear, which he actually threw out so he wouldn’t have to go to practice and could get home in time to pull in his sheet.

Alice is combative and refuses to take the doctor’s advice to stop embarrassing John. At gym class, the coach orders the class to run a mile on the track. He’s astonished to see John build and hold a huge lead on the other boys. He calls the varsity track coach to tell him John has broken the school record, being faster than even the high school seniors. Impressed, the track coach invites John to practice with the track team after school but John declines so he can run home and hide his sheet. Alice refuses to delay hanging his sheet outside if he wants to run track. John’s friends invite him to a sleepover. Alice accepts for him, believing that it will be proof of whether John’s bedwetting is voluntary or involuntary. John reluctantly attends, then spends the entire night awake after the others go to sleep. Alice believes her accusations are confirmed. Nancy’s father shows up after school to surprise her with his new car, a Ford Thunderbird convertible. He offers John a ride home with them, but John starts running down hills and slopes, desperately trying to get home before the Rizzis.

Melnik (Russian: Ион Мельник, born October 11, 1935, Moscow, Soviet Union; died November 15, 2018, Atlanta, Georgia, United States) was a Russian and Soviet era composer. His compositions include songs, choruses, instrumental music, and music to documentary films. Education Ion Melnik began his musical education at the age of seven when he joined the children's ensemble of the USSR Ministry of Railways (Russian: Детский Ансамбль Песни и Пляски Центрального Дома Детей Железнодорожников) where he played the first domra and later became the concertmaster of the orchestra. The music director of the ensemble was Simon Osipovich Dunaevsky (Russian: Семён Осипович Дунаевский), a brother of the legendary Soviet era composer, Isaak Osipovich Dunaevsky (Russian: Исаак Осипович Дунаевский). In 1948, Isaak Osipovich Dunaevsky recommended that Ion Melnik enroll in the Seminar of Young Composers of the USSR's Union of Composers (Russian: Семинар Молодых Композиторов при Союзе Композиторов СССР). At the Seminar, Ion Melnik studied composition under Igor Mikhailovich Belorusets (Russian: Игорь Михайлович Белорусец), an assistant to Mikhail Fibianovich Gnessin (Russian: Михаил Фабианович Гнесин). After the Seminar, Ion Melnik continued to study composition at the Music College affiliated with the Moscow State Conservatory (named after Tchaikovsky) and the Leningrad State Conservatory named after Rimsky-Korsakov.

It is the most developed form of carbonate looping, where a metal (M) is reversibly reacted between its carbonate form (MCO3) and its oxide form (MO) to separate carbon dioxide from other gases coming from either power generation or an industrial plant. In the calcium looping process, the two species are calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium oxide (CaO). The captured carbon dioxide can then be transported to a storage site, used in enhanced oil recovery or used as a chemical feedstock. Calcium oxide is often referred to as the sorbent. Calcium looping is being developed as it is a more efficient, less toxic alternative to current post-combustion capture processes such as amine scrubbing. It also has interesting potential for integration with the cement industry. Basic concept CaCO3 ←→ CaO + CO2 ΔH = +178 kJ/mol There are two main steps in CaL: Calcination: Solid calcium carbonate is fed into a calciner, where it is heated to 850-950 °C to cause it to thermally decompose into gaseous carbon dioxide and solid calcium oxide (CaO). The almost-pure stream of CO2 is then removed and purified so",

It is cooled to approximately 650 °C and is brought into contact with a flue gas containing a low to medium concentration of CO2. The CaO and CO2 react to form CaCO3, thus reducing the CO2 concentration in the flue gas to a level suitable for emission to the atmosphere. This is the 'backward' reaction in the equation above. Note that carbonation is calcination in reverse. Whilst the process can be theoretically performed an infinite number of times, the calcium oxide sorbent degrades as it is cycled. For this reason, it is necessary to remove (purge) some of the sorbent from the system and replace it with fresh sorbent (often in the carbonate form). The size of the purge stream compared with the amount of sorbent going round the cycle affects the process considerably. Background In the Ca-looping process, a CaO-based sorbent, typically derived from limestone, reacts via the reversible reaction described in Equation () and is repeatedly cycled between two vessels. The forward, endothermic step is called calcination while the backward, exothermic step is carbonation. A typical Ca-looping process for post-combustion CO2 capture is shown in Figure 1, followed by a more detailed description. Flue gas containing CO2 is fed to the first vessel (the carbonator), where carbonation occurs. The CaCO3 formed is passed to another vessel (the calciner). Calcination occurs at this stage, and the regenerated CaO is quickly passed back to the carbonator, leaving a pure CO2 stream behind. As this cycle continues, CaO sorbent is constantly replaced by fresh (reactive) sorbent. The highly concentrated CO2 from the calciner is suitable for sequestration, and the spent CaO has potential uses elsewhere, most notably in the cement industry. The heat necessary for calcination can be provided by oxy-combustion of coal below. Oxy-combustion of coal: Pure oxygen rather than air is used for combustion, eliminating the large amount of nitrogen in the flue-gas stream. After particulate matter is removed, flue gas consists only of water vapor and CO2, plus smaller amounts of other pollutants. After compression of the flue gas to remove water vapor and additional removal of air pollutants, a nearly pure CO2 stream suitable for storage is produced. The carbonator's operating temperature of 650-700 °C is chosen as a compromise between higher equilibrium (maximum) capture at lower temperatures due to the exothermic nature of the carbonation step, and a decreased reaction rate. Similarly, the temperature of >850 °C in the calcinator strikes a balance between increased rate of calcination at higher temperatures and reduced rate of degradation of CaO sorbent at lower temperatures. Process description CaL is usually designed using a dual fluidised bed system to ensure sufficient contact between the gas streams and the sorbent. The calciner and carbonator are fluidised beds with associated process equipment for separating the gases and solids attached (such as cyclones). Calcination is an endothermic process and as such requires the application",

        "prompt": "heat to the calciner. The opposite reaction, carbonation, is exothermic and heat must be removed. Since the exothermic reaction happens at about 650 °C and the endothermic reaction at 850-950 °C, the heat from the carbonator cannot be directly used to heat the calciner. The fluidisation of the solid bed in the carbonator is achieved by passing the flue gas through the bed. In the calciner, some of the recovered CO2 is recycled through the system. Some oxygen may also be passed through the reactor if fuel is being burned in the calciner to provide energy. Provision of energy to the calciner Heat can be provided for the endothermic calcination step either directly or indirectly. Direct provision of heat involves the combustion of fuel in the calciner itself (fluidised bed combustion). This is generally assumed to be done under oxy-fuel conditions; i.e. oxygen rather than air is used to burn the fuel to prevent dilution of the CO2 with nitrogen. The provision of oxygen for the combustion uses much electricity; other air separation processes are being developed. Indirect provision of heat to the calciner involves either: Combustion of fuel outside the vessel and conduction of energy in to the vessel Combustion of fuel in another vessel and use of a heat transfer medium. Indirect methods are generally less efficient but do not require the provision of oxygen for combustion within the calciner to prevent dilution. The flue gas from the combustion of fuel in the indirect method could be mixed with the flue gas from the process that the CaL plant is attached to and passed through the carbonator to capture the CO2. Recovery of energy from the carbonator Although the heat from the carbonator is not at a high enough temperature to be used in the calciner, the high temperatures involved (>600 °C) mean that a relatively efficient Rankine cycle for generating electricity can be operated. Note that the waste heat from the market-leading amine scrubbing CO2 capture process is emitted at a maximum of 150 °C. The low temperature of this heat means that it contains much less exergy and can generate much less electricity through a Rankine or organic Rankine cycle. This electricity generation is one of the main benefits of CaL over lower-temperature post-combustion capture processes as the electricity is an extra revenue stream (or reduces costs). Sorbent degradation It has been shown that the activity of the sorbent reduces quite markedly in laboratory, bench-scale and pilot plant tests. This degradation has been attributed to three main mechanisms, as shown below. Attrition Calcium oxide is friable, that is, quite brittle. In fluidised beds, the calcium oxide particles can break apart upon collision with the other particles in the fluidised bed or the vessel containing it. The problem seems to be greater in pilot plant tests than at a bench scale. Sulfation Sulfation is a relatively slow reaction (several hours) compared with carbonation (<10 minutes); thus it is more likely that SO2 will come into contact with CaCO3 than CaO. However, both reactions are possible, and are shown",

        "prompt": "Indirect sulfation: CaO + SO2 + 1/2 O2 → CaSO4 Direct sulfation: CaCO3 + + 1/2 O2 → CaSO4 + CO2 Because calcium sulfate has a greater molar volume than either CaO or CaCO3 a sulfated layer will form on the outside of the particle, which can prevent the uptake of CO2 by the CaO further inside the particle. Furthermore, the temperature at which calcium sulfate dissociates to CaO and SO2 is relatively high, precluding sulfation's reversibility at the conditions present in CaL. Technical implications Calcium looping technology offers several technical advantages over amine scrubbing for carbon capture. Firstly, both carbonator and calciner can use fluidized bed technology, due to the good gas-solid contacting and uniform bed temperature. Fluidized bed technology has already been demonstrated at large scale: large (460MWe) atmospheric and pressurized systems exist, and there is not a need for intensive scaling up as there is for the solvent scrubbing towers used in amine scrubbing. Also, the calcium looping process is energy efficient. The heat required for the endothermic calcination of CaCO3 and the heat required to raise the temperature of fresh limestone from ambient temperature, can be provided by in-situ oxy-fired combustion of fuel in the calciner. Although additional energy is required to separate O2 from N2, the majority of the energy input can be recovered because the carbonator reaction is exothermic and CO2 from the calciner can be used to power a steam cycle. A solid purge heat exchanger can also be utilized to recover energy from the deactivated CaO and coal ashes from the calciner. As a result, a relatively small efficiency penalty is imposed on the power process, where the efficiency penalty refers to the power losses for CO2 compression, air separation and steam generation. It is estimated at 6-8 % points, compared to 9.5-12.5 % from post combustion amine capture. The main shortcoming of Ca-looping technology is the decreased reactivity of CaO through multiple calcination-carbonation cycles. This can be attributed to sintering and the permanent closure of small pores during carbonation. Closure of small pores The carbonation step is characterized by a fast initial reaction rate abruptly followed by a slow reaction rate (Figure 2). The carrying capacity of the sorbent is defined as the number of moles of CO2 reacted in the period of fast reaction rate with respect to that of the reaction stoichiometry for complete conversion of CaO to CaCO3. As seen in Figure 2, while mass after calcination remains constant, the mass change upon carbonation- the carrying capacity- reduces with a large number of cycles. In calcination, porous CaO (molar volume = ) is formed in place of CaCO3 (.). On the other hand, in carbonation, the CaCO3 formed on the surface of a CaO particle occupies a larger molar volume. As a result, once a layer of carbonate has formed on the surface (including on the large internal surface of porous CaO), it impedes further CO2 capture. This product layer grows over the pores and seals them off, forcing carbonation to follow a slower, diffusion dependent mechanism. Sintering CaO",

Ionic compounds such as CaO mostly sinter because of volume diffusion or lattice diffusion mechanics. As described by sintering theory, vacancies generated by temperature sensitive defects direct void sites from smaller to larger ones, explaining the observed growth of large pores and the shrinkage of small pores in cycled limestone. It was found that sintering of CaO increases at higher temperatures and longer calcination durations, whereas carbonation time has minimal effect on particle sintering. A sharp increase in sintering of particles is observed at temperatures above 1173 K, causing a reduction in reactive surface area and a corresponding decrease in reactivity. Solutions: Several options to reduce sorbent deactivation are currently being researched. An ideal sorbent would be mechanically strong, maintain its reactive surface through repeated cycles, and be reasonably inexpensive. Using thermally pre-activated particles or reactivating spent sorbents through hydration are two promising options. Thermally pre-activated particles have been found to retain activity for up to a thousand cycles. Similarly, particles reactivated by hydration show improved long term (after~20 cycles) conversions. Disposal of waste sorbent Properties of waste sorbent After cycling several times and being removed from the calcium loop, the waste sorbent will have attrited, sulfated and become mixed with the ash from any fuel used. The amount of ash in the waste sorbent will depend on the fraction of the sorbent being removed and the ash and calorific content of the fuel. The size fraction of the sorbent is dependent on the original size fraction but also the number of cycles used and the type of limestone used. Disposal routes Proposed disposal routes of waste sorbent include: Landfill; Disposal at sea; Use in cement manufacture; Use in flue gas desulfurisation (FGD). The lifecycle CO2 emissions for power generation with CaL and the first three disposal techniques have been calculated. Before disposal of the CaO coal power with CaL has a similar level of lifecycle emissions as amine scrubbing but with the CO2-absorbing properties of CaO CaL becomes significantly less polluting. Ocean disposal was found to be the best, but current laws relating to dumping waste at sea prevent this. Next best was use in cement manufacture, reducing emissions over an unabated coal plant by 93%. Use in cement manufacture Portland cement is approximately two-thirds calcium oxide by mass and its manufacture is responsible for approximately 8% of the world's CO2 emissions. 60% of this CO2 comes from the calcination of calcium carbonate as shown earlier in this article, and the other 40% from fossil fuel combustion. By replacing some or all of the calcium carbonate entering the plant with waste calcium oxide, the CO2 caused from calcination can be avoided, as well as some of the CO2 from fossil fuel combustion. This calcium oxide could be sourced from other point sources of CO2 such as power stations, but most effort has been focussed on integrating calcium looping with Portland cement manufacture.

There are alternative set-ups such as placing the calcium looping plant in the preheater section so as to make the plant as efficient as possible. Some work has been undertaken into whether calcium looping affects the quality of the Portland cement produced, but results so far seem to suggest that the production of strength-giving phases such as alite are similar for calcium looped and non-calcium looped cement. Direct Separation Technology Calix Ltd has developed a new type of kiln that enables the from the calcination process to be driven off as a pure stream. Calix achieves this by calcining finely ground CaCO3 continuously down vertical reactor tubes. The reactor tubes are heated from the outside using electricity or fuel ensuring the stream is pure and not contaminated with air or combustion products. This technology has been successfully piloted in Europe by a cooperative industry group with support from the European Union as the Low Emission Intensity Lime And Cement (LEILAC1) reactor project. The study report concluded that the technology could capture C02 from full scale lime and cement kilns at €14 to €24/t. Transport and storage costs are not included in this estimate and will be dependent upon infrastructure available near the cement or lime plant A FEED study is underway for a larger commercial demonstration kiln proposed for the Heidelberg Cement plant in Hannover (LEILAC2). This commercial demonstration kiln is designed to capture 100ktpa . A final investment decision for this project is expected early 2022. This type of kiln is also being studied as a potential method to decarbonise shipping through both looping and single use processes. The single use process would involve using CaCO3 to be sown over the ocean, thereby permanently capturing addition carbon from the ocean as the CaCO3 reacts to form Ca(HCO3)2 and reversing ocean acidification. Economic implications Calcium looping has several economic advantages. Cost per metric ton for CO2 captured Firstly, Ca-looping offers greater cost advantage compared to conventional amine-scrubbing technologies. The cost/metric ton for CO2 captured through Ca-looping is ~$23.70 whereas that for CO2 captured through amine scrubbing is about $35–$96. This can be attributed to the high availability and low cost of the CaO sorbent (derived from limestone) as compared to MEA. Also, Ca-looping imposes a lower energy penalty than amine scrubbing, resulting in lower energy costs. The amine scrubbing process is energy intensive, with approximately 67% of the operating costs going into steam requirements for solvent regeneration. A more detailed comparison of Ca-looping and amine scrubbing is shown below. Cost of CO2 emissions avoided through Ca-looping In addition, the cost of CO2 emissions avoided through Ca-looping is lower than the cost of emissions avoided via an oxyfuel combustion process (~US$23.8/t). This can be explained by the fact that, despite the capital costs incurred in constructing the carbonator for Ca-looping, CO2 will not only be captured from the oxy-fired combustion, but also from the main combustor (before the carbonator). The oxygen required in the calciners is only 1/3 that",

        "prompt": "for an oxyfuel process, lowering air separation unit capital costs and operating costs. Sensitivity Analysis: Figure 3 shows how varying 8 separate parameters affects the cost/metric ton of CO2 captured through Ca-looping. It is evident that the dominant variables that affect cost are related to sorbent use, the Ca/C ratio and the CaO deactivation ratio. This is because the large sorbent quantities required dominate the economics of the capture process. These variables should therefore be taken into account to achieve further cost reductions in the Ca-looping process. The cost of limestone is largely driven by market forces, and is outside the control of the plant. Currently, carbonators require a Ca/C ratio of 4 for effective CO2 capture. However, if the Ca/C ratio or CaO deactivation is reduced (i.e. the sorbent can be made to work more efficiently), the reduction in material consumption and waste can lower feedstock demand and operating costs. Cement production Finally, favorable economics can be achieved by using the purged material from the calcium looping cycle in cement production. The raw feed for cement production includes ~ 85 wt% limestone with the remaining material consisting of clay and additives (e.g. SiO2, Al2O3 etc.). The first step in the process involves calcinating limestone to produce CaO, which is then mixed with other materials in a kiln to produce clinker. Using purged material from a Ca-looping system would reduce the raw material costs for cement production. Waste CaO and ash can be used in place of CaCO3 (the main constituent cement feed). The ash could also fulfill the aluminosilicate requirements otherwise supplied by additives. Since over 60% of the energy used in cement production goes into heat input for the precalciner, this integration with Ca-looping and the consequent reduced need for a calcination step, could lead to substantial energy savings (EU, 2001). However, there are problems with using the waste CaO in cement manufacture. If the technology is applied on a large scale, the purge rate of CaO should be optimized to minimize waste. Political and environmental implications To fully gauge the viability of calcium looping as a capture process, it is necessary to consider the political, environmental, and health effects of the process as well. Political implications Though many recent scientific reports (e.g.: the seven-wedge stabilization plan by Pacala and Socolow) convey an urgent need to deploy CCS, this urgency has not spread to the political establishment, mainly due to the high costs and energy penalty of CCS The economics of calcium looping are integral to its political viability. One economic and political advantage is the ability for Ca-looping to be retrofitted onto existing power plants, rather than requiring new plants to be built. The IEA sees power plants as an important target for carbon capture, and has set the goal to have all fossil fuel based power plants deploy CCS systems by 2040. However, power plants are expensive to build, and long lived. Retrofitting of post-combustion capture systems, such as Ca-looping, seems to be the only politically and economically viable way to achieve the IEA's goal. A further",

An IEA report concludes that to meet emission reduction goals, there should be 450 CCS projects in India and China by 2050. However, this could be politically difficult, especially with these nations' numerous other development goals. After all, for a politician to commit money to CCS might be less advantageous than to commit it to job schemes or agricultural subsidies. Here, the integration of calcium looping with the prosperous and (particularly with infrastructure expansion in the developing world) vital cement industry might prove compelling to the political establishment. This potential synergy with the cement industry also provides environmental benefits by simultaneously reducing the waste output of the looping process and decarbonizing cement production. Cement manufacture is energy and resource intensive, consuming 1.5 tonnes of material per tonne of cement produced. In the developing world, economic growth will drive infrastructure growth, increasing cement demand. Deploying a waste product for cement production could therefore have a large, positive environmental impact. Environmental implications The starting material for calcium looping is limestone, which is environmentally benign and widely available, accounting for over 10% (by volume) of all sedimentary rock. Limestone is already mined and cheaply obtainable. The mining process has no major known adverse environmental effects, beyond the unavoidable intrusiveness of any mining operation. However, as the following calculation shows, despite integration with cement industry, waste from Ca-looping can still be a problem. From the environmental and health standpoint, Ca-looping compares favorably with amine scrubbing. Amine scrubbing is known to generate air pollutants, including amines and ammonia, which can react to form carcinogenic nitrosamines. Calcium looping, on the other hand, does not produce harmful pollutants. In addition, not only does it capture CO2, but it also removes the pollutant SO2 from the flue gas. This is both an advantage and disadvantage, as the air quality improves, but the captured SO2 has a detrimental effect on the cement that is generated from the calcium looping wastes. Advantages and drawbacks Advantages of the process Calcium looping is considered as potential promising solutions to reduce CO2 capture energy penalty. There are many advantages from the calcium looping methods. Firstly, the method has been proved to yield a low efficiency penalties (5-8% points) while other mature CO2 capture systems yield a higher efficiency penalties (8-12.5%). Moreover, the method is well suited for a wide range of flue gases. Calcium looping is applicable for new builds and retrofits to existing power stations or other stationary industrial CO2 sources because the method can be implemented using large-scale circulating fluidized beds while other methods such as amine scrubbing is required a vastly upscale solvent scrubbing towers. In addition, crushed limestone used in calcium looping as the sorbent is a natural product, which is well distributed all over the world, non-hazardous and inexpensive.

Benefits of calcium looping compared with other post-combustion capture processes Calcium looping compares favorably with several post-combustion capture technologies. Amine scrubbing is the capture technology closest to being market-ready, and calcium looping has several marked benefits over it. When modeled on a 580 MW coal-fired power plant, Calcium looping experienced not only a smaller efficiency penalty (6.7-7.9% points compared to 9.5% for monoethanolamine and 9% for chilled ammonia) but also a less complex retrofitting process. Both technologies would require the plant to be retrofitted for adoption, but the calcium looping retrofitting process would result in twice the net power output of the scrubbing technology. Furthermore, this advantage can be compounded by introducing technology such as cryogenic O2 separation systems. This ups the efficiency of the calcium looping technology by increasing the energy density by 57.4%, making the already low energy penalties even less of an issue. Calcium looping already has an energy advantage over amine scrubbing, but the main problem is that amine scrubbing is the more market-ready technology. However, the accompanying infrastructure for amine scrubbing include large solvent scrubbing towers, the likes of which have never been used on an industrial scale. The accompanying infrastructure for calcium looping capture technologies are circulating fluidized beds, which have already been implemented on an industrial scale. Although the individual technologies differ in terms of current technological viability, the fact that the infrastructure needed to properly implement an amine scrubbing system has yet to be developed keeps calcium looping competitive from a viability standpoint. Sample evaluation Assumptions For a Ca-looping cycle installed on a 500 MW power plant, the purge rate is 12.6 kg CaO/s. For the cement production process, 0.65 kg CaO is required/ kg cement produced. U.S. electric generation capacity (only fossil fuels): Natural gas = 415 GW, Coal= 318 GW & Petroleum = 51 GW Cement consumption in U.S. = 110,470 × 103 metric tons = 1.10470 × 108 metric tons = 1.10470 × 1011 kg. Calculations For a single Ca-looping cycle installed on a 500MW power plant: Amount of CaO from purge annually = 12.6 kg CaO/s × 365 days/year × 24 hr/day × 3600s / hour = 3.97 × 108 kg CaO/ year Cement that can be obtained from purge annually= 3.97 × 108 kg CaO/ year × 1 kg cement/ 0.65 kg CaO = 6.11 × 108 kg cement/year Net electricity generation in US: (415 + 318",

Life Sainthill Eardley-Wilmot was born in 1852, son of Augustus Hillier Eardley-Wilmot (1818-1892), of Upper Berkeley Street, Portman Square, London, and Matilda Jessie (1827-1904), daughter of banker John Dunn, of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. His paternal grandfather was Sir John Eardley-Wilmot, 1st Baronet, who served as governor of Van Diemen's Land, Tasmania. His unusual forename originated from his ancestor Frances Sainthill. Eardley-Wilmot married Emma, daughter of George Casey, on 1 December 1884. Emma died shortly after the birth of their first child, Helen. He later married Mabel Boisragon Winter, daughter of W.H. Winter in 1891; they had one daughter, Mabel, who married George Herbert Dummett and was mother of the philosopher Michael Dummett. Career and conservation work After the completion of his education he joined the Indian Forest Service in December 1873. Eardly-Wilmot was appointed to the old North-West Provinces and Oudh region of colonial India. He rose to prominence within the Indian Forest Service for his conservation lead method and unorthodox approach. He advocated methods of numbering and ageing trees, surveying methods which were not common on the Indian sub-continent at that time. Eardley-Wilmot also introduced a ban on the felling of the best specimens which had been a common practice in Colonial India. In 1906, Sir Eardley-Wilmot created the Forest Research Institute to promote greater understanding of the forests of the Indian sub-continent. In recognition of his work in India and Burma, Sir Sainthill Eardley-Wilmot became a Knight Commander of Order of the Indian Empire in 1911.

Macdonald was a trailblazer in Canadian art from the 1930s to 1960. He was the first painter to exhibit abstract art in Vancouver, and throughout his life he championed Canadian avant-garde artists at home and abroad. His career path reflected the times: despite his commitment to his artistic practice, he earned his living as a teacher, becoming a mentor to several generations of artists. Early life Macdonald was born in May 1897 in Thurso, Scotland. Before coming to Canada, Macdonald graduated with a Specialists Teacher's Certificate from the Scottish Education Authority and a diploma in design from the Edinburgh College of Art in 1922. His first major employment was as a designer for a Scottish textile company, then he worked for the Lincoln School of Art as Head of Design in 1925. Career After being recruited by Charles Hepburn Scott, Macdonald moved to Canada in 1926 to become a professor at the Vancouver School of Decorative and Applied Arts. He became well-known and respected as a teacher at art colleges in Canada at Vancouver, Calgary, and Toronto. Macdonald was initially inspired by the work of the Group of Seven and mentored by F.H. Varley, used bold colour and form to paint the British Columbia landscape but began painting abstracts in 1934. In 1941, he became president of the British Columbia Society of Artists and in that capacity attended the Kingston Conference which developed over time into the Canada Council for the Arts. Macdonald's training as a designer and his interest in children's paintings encouraged his experimentation with abstract art as did his interest in automatic painting. Automatic painting showed him an unexpected way to express all of the feelings which vanished if the approach was objective. He said: \"I felt that the curve of a wave, the breaker on the beach and the foam on the sand wasn`t all of the sea. The sea has solidity and transparency, cruelty and tenderness, joy and terror, cunning and friendship, all included in visual observation.\" In the mid-1940s, Macdonald taught at the Banff School of Fine Arts. There, in 1946, he met Calgary artist Marion Nicoll, who was hired to teach the summer program, and exerted a profound influence on her work by introducing her to automatic drawing and watercolour. In the summers of 1948 and 1949, Macdonald studied with Hans Hofmann in Provincetown, Massachusetts. In 1954, he worked and studied in Scotland, London and France. He settled in Nice where he showed his watercolours to Jean Dubuffet who advised him to \"speak in oil as you do in watercolour\". His breakthrough came when Harold Town introduced him to a new paint material, Lucite 44. The new freedom he found using this medium mixed with oil transformed his work.

The name of the street was a reference to another street, Arseninkatu (current ), which ran from a bridge of the Aura River to Uudenmaan tulli (lit. Uusimaa customs). Both streets were named after the Russian Arseny Zakrevsky, who served as the Governor-General of Finland from 1824 to 1831. As the governor general, Zakrevsky led the reparations of the city after the Great Fire of Turku in 1827. The name of Arsenin poikkikatu was changed to Arseninkatu (Swedish: Arseniigatan) in 1890, when the original Arseninkatu was renamed as Uudenmaankatu. The Russian based street names of Turku were replaced during the 1920s, and also Arseninkatu was renamed as Sirkkalankatu (Swedish: Sirkkalagatan; lit. Sirkkala Street) in 1924. The new name was based on a fact that there had long existed a hill called Sirkkalanmäki on the route of Arseninkatu.

The district includes approximately 20 city blocks on or near Southeast Grand Avenue on the east side of the Willamette River, roughly bounded on the south by SE Main Street, north by SE Ankeny Street, west by SE Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, and east by SE Seventh Avenue. Most structures in the district are commercial buildings rising two to three stories. Immediately to the west of the historic district is Portland's east side industrial area, and to the east are industrial and residential areas. History The historic district is part of a larger area originally designated in 1850 as the East Portland Townsite. In 1861 James B. Stephens platted the area into 200-foot by 200-foot blocks from a portion of his donation land claim. The townsite was roughly bounded by the Willamette River to the west, 12th Street to the east, Glisan Street to the north, and Hawthorne Street to the south. By 1870, the Oregon Central Railroad included a branch through East Portland, and the community was incorporated in 1871. Commercial development increased, and in 1891 East Portland was annexed into the city of Portland. Designation of buildings The historic period of significance for the district is 1883 through 1930. Buildings designated as \"primary\" contributing properties were constructed between 1883 and 1915. Those designated as \"secondary\" were constructed between 1916 and 1930. A third designation, \"historic but non-contributing,\" denotes buildings constructed within the period of significance but which have been modernized or altered beyond their historic identity. The East Portland Grand Avenue Historic District includes a total of 74 properties, and 50 are designated either primary, secondary, or historic non-contributing. A fourth designation, \"non-contributing,\" denotes buildings constructed after 1930 The district contains six non-contributing buildings and 18 vacant lots.

It is endemic to San Bernardino County, California, where it is known only from the San Bernardino Mountains. There are about 20 occurrences known. Description This is a perennial herb growing up to 15 centimeters tall and covered in a coat of ash-gray woolly hairs. The leaves are linear or narrowly lance-shaped and one or two centimeters long. The inflorescence is made up of fuzzy dull to bright reddish or purplish pink bracts between which emerge smaller yellowish to greenish flowers. The color of the inflorescence is influenced by the environment of the plant; those with more northern exposures tend to have yellowish flowers and those facing south have more reddish flowers. Like other Castilleja species, this plant parasitizes other species for water and nutrients; C. cinerea is generally found tapping buckwheats (Eriogonum spp.) and sagebrushes (Artemisia spp.).

He began training in Aikido in Osaka in 1942 and went on to train directly under the founder of the art Morihei Ueshiba at Iwama as an uchideshi during World War II. In 1952, after graduating in law from Waseda University, he moved to France where he studied law at the Sorbonne and taught aikido as a 6th Dan representative of Aikikai Honbu. After seven years he returned to Japan. By 1964 he was a 7th dan black belt in aikido. Aikido had been introduced into France a year earlier by Minoru Mochizuki during a visit, but it was Tadashi Abe's teaching at the judo dojo of Mikonosuke Kawaishi where aikido was first taught on a regular basis in the west. In his beginning years in aikido, Abe had been very keen on ascertaining the martial effectiveness of the art. He wrote two books on aikido in French language, and a scathing letter in critique of Koichi Tohei´s decision to break from the Aikikai and start his own Ki Society He was the cousin of Yoshimitsu Yamada.

Gordon. Based loosely on H. G. Wells's 1904 book The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth, it contains elements of the beach party film genre. The story concerns a gang of rebellious youngsters who gain access to a chemical substance called \"Goo\", which causes living things to grow to gigantic proportions. The cast is composed almost entirely of teenaged actors and young adults portraying teenagers. Also making musical guest appearances are The Beau Brummels, Freddy Cannon, and Mike Clifford. Gordon would later direct another adaptation of Wells' story, titled The Food of the Gods. Plot Village of the Giants takes place in fictional Hainesville, California. After crashing their car into a roadblock during a rainstorm, a group of partying, big-city teenagers (Fred, Pete, Rick, Harry, and their girlfriends Merrie, Elsa, Georgette and Jean) first indulge in a vigorous, playful mud-wrestling fight, then hike their way into town.

Genius accidentally creates a substance he names \"Goo\", that, when consumed, causes animals, including a dog and a pair of ducks, to grow to gigantic size. The out-of-town teens break into the local theater and clean up from the rain, then go to a nearby club where The Beau Brummels are performing. Shortly, the giant ducks turn up, followed by Mike and Nancy. Everyone is astounded by the size of the ducks, wondering how they got so big. Mike explains that it's a secret, but following a suggestion made by their friends Horsey and Red, they host a picnic in the town square the next day, roasting the ducks and feeding everybody. Freddy Cannon is featured singing a song in this scene. Fred and his friends also see potential in whatever made the ducks grow, but their minds are purely on profit. They scheme to learn the secret, and are ultimately successful, escaping with a sample. Back at the theater, the gang argues over what to do with the Goo, now that they have it. Feeling peer pressure, Fred slices up the Goo, giving everyone a piece each, which they consume a moment later. As the Goo takes effect, they each grow to over thirty feet (9 m) tall, ripping right out of their clothes. At first everyone is shocked and regretful, but realizing their newfound power at their new size, the gang decide to take over the town. Overnight, the giants decide to isolate Hainesville from the rest of the world. They rip out the telephone lines, overturn broadcasting antennas, and block the remaining roads out of town. When the sheriff and Mike arrive to deal with them, they discover that the giants have no plans to leave – and are literally holding the sheriff's daughter, as \"insurance\" that they won't have any trouble. While the town's adults seem paralyzed, the teens decide to fight back. An attempt to capture Fred results in Nancy being taken hostage. Meanwhile, Genius continues to work, trying to produce more Goo. Mike asks Genius to forget the Goo for a while and make them a supply of ether – having noticed the giants only leave one guard on the hostages. Mike and Horsey plot to subdue that guard, recover the guns, and free Nancy and the sheriff's daughter. Having led the giants outside the theater, Mike plays David to Fred's Goliath, to distract them while Horsey and the others effect the rescue. Genius' newest attempt at Goo results in an antidote. He rides over to the square on a bicycle with a pail full of the fuming antidote. As the giants breathe in the fumes, they all return to normal.

Cast Music The film's instrumental theme song, by composer and arranger Jack Nitzsche, was originally released as \"The Last Race\" on Reprise Records, months before the movie appeared, and which would later be used as the main title music for Death Proof, Quentin Tarantino's portion of the film Grindhouse, in 2007. The Beau Brummels, singers Freddy Cannon and Mike Clifford all make appearances. Cannon enjoyed a string of hits during the 1960s, including \"Palisades Park\" and \"Tallahassee Lassie\", and performs \"Little Bitty Corrine\" in his signature style (wearing a cardigan sweater in the summertime), while Mike Clifford (veteran of The Ed Sullivan Show, and later an actor) croons the movie's obligatory slow song, \"Marianne\". Clifford is also credited with another song, \"Nothing can Stand in my Way\", but this does not appear in the film. There was no official soundtrack release for this movie. Production notes Director The film's director, Bert I. Gordon, was involved with many size-themed movies in his career (perhaps coincidentally, his initials are \"BIG\"). Besides Village, these include: King Dinosaur (1955), Beginning of the End (1957), The Cyclops (1957), The Amazing Colossal Man (1957), Attack of the Puppet People (1958), War of the Colossal Beast (1958), Earth vs. the Spider (1958), and The Food of the Gods (1976). The film was made by Gordon's newly formed Berkeley Productions. It was to be the first of a three-year 12-picture deal between Berkeley and Joseph E. Levine's Embassy Productions. Some of these were to be for TV, others for theaters. The next two planned films were titled The Creatures of Dr. Freak and Horror House, but neither of these were made. Casting The cast features a number of children of established Hollywood actors: Beau Bridges (son of Lloyd Bridges), Ron Howard (son of Rance Howard), Tisha Sterling (daughter of Robert Sterling and Ann Sothern), Toni Basil (daughter of Louis Basil) and Tim Rooney (son of Mickey Rooney). Debi Storm completed her role as the sheriff's daughter in just three days. Vicki London, who played Georgette, is absent from the screen for most of the giant scenes in the film. Robert Random and Joy Harmon each also appeared in episodes of Gidget, which debuted in the fall of 1965. The cat appearing in this film was named Orangey (later renamed Minerva), and Village of the Giants was the second time he played the role of a cat larger than a human, the first being Scott Carey's (actor Grant Williams) pet in The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957). His most famous roles were as \"Rhubarb\" in the film Rhubarb (1951) and the cat in Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961). Tommy Kirk made the film after his arrest for drug possession. He later said he wasn't \"too embarrassed\" about the film. \"It's kind of a crazy movie but the production values are pretty good and it sort of holds together.

He later recalled: When I did it, I was about 18 or 19, and I took it all quite seriously. I thought it was my chance to really be a spokesperson for my generation, you know? I had that long speech when I'm in the theater, and I've eaten this goo ... I address the police chief of the town about the young people, the teenagers, that he says are losing control, and I speak out about freedom and everything. I took it so seriously, and I think I even rewrote my lines. Now, though, it's, uh, a little embarrassing. Original script Alan Caillou's original script called for the sheriff's deputy (played by Rance Howard) to be stepped on by the giants. If the scene was ever filmed, it did not make the final edit, and no known footage of it exists. Locations and props Most of the outdoor scenes were filmed on the Columbia Pictures backlot, where portions of I Dream of Jeannie and The Partridge Family were also made. The lot is now owned by Warner Brothers. The scene where the giants convene outside the Hainesville theater was shot at the Courthouse Square lot at Universal Studios, where Back to the Future and Gremlins were later made. The film's goo was a simple mixture of angel food cake mix with pink-colored dye. The beer the \"teenagers\" are drinking at the beginning of the film is Blatz, and the 'Teen magazine Joy Harmon reads during one part of the film is an actual issue, from the summer of 1965. The tiny yellow custom hotrod (with the surfboard) that is used in the street scene to tie up Beau Bridges' feet is The Surfite, designed by Ed \"Big Daddy\" Roth. Release and reception The low-budget film had limited commercial success at the time of its release, for it was distributed mainly to drive-in theaters as part of double features. In 1965 it did draw media attraction and audiences with some of its special effects and lightly provocative sex appeal, including scenes with implied nudity. Margaret Hartford of the Los Angeles Times, for example, alludes to those elements in her review at the time. The \"best things\" about the film, she writes, are the \"special effects and photographic trickery\", along with \"those endless views of healthy young torsos gyrating to the rhythms of the Beau Brummells or Freddy Cannon\". Hartford adds, \"Alan Caillou's script keeps the action fast and the dancing swinging.\" Mystery Science Theater 3000 On January 11, 1994, an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (episode 523) featuring Village of the Giants premiered on Comedy Central.

Gungrave follows its main character through a variety of stages on a path of revenge. While the gameplay received moderate reviews, Gungrave received acclaim for the character designs provided by series creator Yasuhiro Nightow (Trigun) and mechanical designs provided by Kōsuke Fujishima (Oh My Goddess! series, You're Under Arrest series, Sakura Wars series). Both artists' respective styles helped give the game a distinct feel, which (along with fan support) helped Gungrave translate from a video game to an anime series as well as a video game sequel for the PlayStation 2 entitled Gungrave: Overdose in 2004. Cinematics were provided by Ikusabune Co., Ltd., which developed the sequel with Red Entertainment's supervision. Gameplay As a third-person shooter, Gungrave focuses on combat. The player advances through hallway-like stages, but has a free range of motion in these areas. The player confronts wave after wave of fighters en route to an end-level boss. Combat varies between gunplay with enemies at a distance and simple melee combat at close range, and the game rates the amount of flair the player uses to destroy everyone and everything in sight. Players control Beyond the Grave, who is equipped with a damage-absorbing energy shield that can absorb a large amount of damage in addition to his life bar.

To build the beat meter, Beyond the Grave must perform combos sometimes numbering in hundreds of hits (destroying enemies or practically anything in the game environment). Strategy is required in setting up combos that are as long and devastating as possible, which helps to carry on the over-the-top action of the game. Stages and some important events within stages are separated by anime cutscenes featuring art by Nightow. This is where the game's story takes place. Characters are expanded on and the player is given a back-story that is not obvious through gameplay alone. Story Setting The game takes place in an unknown city that is controlled by the Millennion organization. The city is overrun by crime and a mysterious drug known as seed. The story follows Grave as he sets out on a course for revenge against the man who killed him, his former best friend and colleague from Millenion, Harry Macdowell. Stages in the game are presented as missions issued by Dr. T, and follow Grave as he hunts down the boss of that stage. Settings include a bar, a lab, the subway, and even a traditional Japanese dojo set atop a sky scraper. These environments are complemented or contrasted by the urban environment that surrounds them. Plot The game opens with the young girl dragging an oversized attaché case toward a warehouse with difficulty. \"Bloody\" Harry Macdowell has just carried out a coup against Big Daddy, the leader of the Millennion organization, and his daughter Mika needs to find someone that can protect her and stop Harry's mad plans. The occupants of this warehouse include a kindly looking old doctor, and a man with a notable scar on his face. Mika arrives, and the man with the scar claims the contents of the case: two massive handguns. That man is revealed to be the game's title character Grave, and now that he is armed he can start his mission. Gungrave first approaches its stages as a series of missions issued by Dr. T, first to gather information on the current makeup of Millennion from a low-level street gang, and next destroying a research facility that creates Harry's undead soldiers. In the third stage, while attempting to pump information from an informant, Grave comes into contact with the leadership of the Millenion organization—once friends and allies that he now faces as enemies. Each have used the research Harry supported to give themselves inhuman powers. From here on, Grave is hounded by each member as he makes his way to Harry's tower at the heart of the city.

Brandon even let Big Daddy marry the woman he loved so that she could find a better life, but the two remained close. Not content with the power he had been given, Harry asked Brandon to help him kill Big Daddy so that he could take over. When Brandon refused, Harry shot his friend in the left eye, killing him. Fifteen years later, Harry carried out his coup. His actions as leader inspired Dr. T to revive Brandon who was the only person capable of stopping Harry. Dr. T's connection to all of this is not made clear, but he often makes comments that indicate some connection to Brandon's former life. Grave picks apart the leadership of Millennion to make his way to Harry. At the top of the tower that Harry uses as a headquarters, it is revealed that Big Daddy still lives in the form of a twisted monster. Harry forces Grave to fight his creation, and following the final battle, Harry accepts his defeat graciously and allows his friend to kill him. With Harry defeated, Mika's protection becomes Grave's only concern, and to keep his promise to Big Daddy of protecting the family, Grave protects Mika while they drive away from this tragedy. Development The game was inspired by multiple action films, most notably those by John Woo. The gameplay was developed in order to be unique rather than a typical action game.

        "prompt": "1960s, and then breaking from An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha to become an independent organisation, An Chomhdháil is today the second-largest Irish dance organisation and one of six to run a World Championships competition. An Chomhdháil operates a system of examinations for the registration of teachers and adjudicators, and regulates Irish stepdance at its hierarchical system of competitions held across the world. It emphasises a democratic approach to this governance and represents the interests of Irish dancing teachers in its decision making processes. History Prior to the establishment of An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha in 1927 by the Gaelic League, with its goal of unifying and controlling Irish dance across Ireland, various organisations of Irish dance teachers had existed in the major cities of Ireland. The oldest among them, the Cork Irish Dance Teachers' Association, was founded in 1895 and played a key role in the establishment of the first oireachtas of the Gaelic League. Another, the Leinster Dance Teachers' Association, was founded in Dublin in 1924, but both associations were more or less defunct by the early 1930s. In its early years of existence, An Coimisiún began to develop a system of examinations, centralised registration of teachers and a hierarchical competition structure. However, because the organisation was a component of the Gaelic League's nationalist agenda, there was little to no representation of dance teachers' interests within its decision-making processes. As a consequence, from 1961 onwards, dance teachers began to organise their own regular democratic conventions and protocols. Early conventions dealt largely with technical matters such as the regulation of shoes and dances, and throughout the 1960s, submitted its decisions to An Coimisiún, where they were largely accepted and made official. As a result, by the later years of the decade, most teachers of Irish dance registered with An Coimisiún had also registered with the dance teachers' organisations. The combined local teachers' associations which led this movement were collectively known as the Irish Dancing Teachers' Association, until the 1967 convention when a new constitution was drafted under the name of Comhdháil Múinteori Na Rinci Gaelach. Beginning at the 1967 convention, later to become known as the Gormanston Convention for its location at Gormanston College in County Meath, An Chomhdháil began attempts to increase its standing within the An Coimisiún structure, including structural representation and compulsory dual registration for all of An Coimisiún's certified teachers. This quickly developed into significant tension between the organisations and resulted in further moves by An Chomhdháil to assert its autonomy, including registering teachers in North America. At around the same time, An Coimisiún began to experiment with delegating its authority to regional councils, restructuring the Ulster Commission, which had previously functioned with limited autonomy in organising Irish Dancing in the Ulster region, to deal with concerns being raised about a feis held in Northern Ireland. This incident, along with increasing dissent with An Coimisiún's nationalist agenda and autocratic structure, led to the complete breakdown of relations between the two organisations. As a result, in 1969, a special convention of An Chomhdháil was called to discuss the",

        "prompt": "dissatisfaction with An Coimisiún's attempts to extend its power, and a vote was carried 91 to 2, with 31 abstentions, to separate from An Coimisiún entirely. At the end of that year, all teachers were forced to register either with An Coimisiún or An Chomhdháil. This event was to become known as \"the Split\", and had a significant impact on An Coimisiún, with the loss of nearly half of its registered teachers within Ireland. By early 1970, An Chomhdháil had created its own register of teachers and adjudicators, and in the following years quickly implemented a system of examinations similar to that of An Coimisiún. Gradually, its teachers began to establish their own feiseanna. In 1982, Cumann Rince Náisiúnta was formed by a group of 12 teachers dissatisfied with the activities of An Chomhdháil. An Chomhdháil consequently closed its platform of competitions, which had previously been open to any dancer registered with any organisation, to be open only to dancers affiliated with An Chomhdháil teachers. The cultural impact of the Riverdance performance at the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest saw a significant increase in Irish dancing participation, as well as contributing to the globalisation of the competitive structure. An Chomhdháil saw an increase in its competition numbers comparable with those of other extant stepdance organisations. However, it also adopted a role as one of the two most important organisations for the training and preparation of professional dancers. The popularity of Irish dance shows quickly created an additional motivation for success in competitive Irish dance. A 2007 rule change banned the use of makeup for competitors under the age of 13, in response to broad criticism of Irish stepdance generally for its dependence on costuming and appearance. In 2012, An Chomhdháil began to market its largest competition as the \"World Irish Dance Championships\", to compete with the larger Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne (Irish Dancing World Championships) event held by An Coimisiún. Its entries were composed largely of dancers from Ireland and the United Kingdom. An Chomhdháil struggled to make an initial impression on the American continent, with very few registered teachers in its North American region, and the first feis affiliated with An Chomhdháil in the United States was not held until June 2013 in California. Over the following years, five further annual feiseanna were introduced in North America. The North American region was also divided into two to cater for the increased number of registered teachers. In 2017, An Chomhdháil's World Championships were expanded to use two competition stages for the first time, in response to a record number of entries in both solo and ceili dance events. By this time, the Worlds had begun to attract dancers from a wider region of the globe. Operations There are 28 branches of An Chomhdháil, each of which is individually responsible for promoting and organising Irish dance in its region. An Chomhdháil is governed by its annual Convention, held in August, at which all registered teachers and adjudicators may vote on rule changes. It also has an Executive Committee and Panel of Examiners which",

Examinations An Chomhdháil shares with An Coimisiún a rigorous system of examinations for the certification of dance teachers and adjudicators, and also shares the terminology used to describe the qualifications. Furthermore, An Chomhdháil accepts teachers and adjudicators who have received equivalent qualifications from another organisation. The qualifications available are: Teastais de Comhdháil na Rince Gaelacha (TCRG) – qualified to teach in An Comhdháil registered schools. (An Coimisiún equivalent: Teastais de Coimisiún na Rince Gaelacha) Ard Diploma na Comhdháil na Rince Gaelacha (ADCRG) – qualified to adjudicate An Comhdháil registered competitions. (An Coimisiún equivalent: Ard Diploma de Coimisiún na Rince Gaelacha) Muinteoir Rince Gaelacha – qualified to teach ceili dances only. (An Coimisún equivalent: TMRF) There is also a system of 10 examinations for competing dancers over the age of 8, which test practical and theoretical knowledge and provide additional feedback for participants. Competitions An Chomhdháil's operations are based around a hierarchical system of competition, mirroring that of An Coimisiún and other organisations. Competitions organised by An Chomhdháil promote a larger number of traditional set dances, that is, dances to specified tunes which are relatively consistent in their choreography, than other organisations. An Chomhdháil is one of six Irish stepdance organisation to host a World Championships event Like An Coimisiún's Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne, An Chomhdháil's World Championships are held annually at Easter.

She was bred by Allaire du Pont and raced under her Bohemia Stable banner. Her sire, Amerigo, a son of the great Nearco, was a stakes winner of races in England and the United States including the Coventry Stakes, New York Handicap and the San Juan Capistrano Handicap. Her dam was Morn Again, a daughter of Calumet Farm's multiple stakes winner Sun Again. When Politely, trained by George Baker, raced at age three, her best outing was a third to 1965 American Horse of the Year Moccasin in the 1966 Test Stakes. At ages four and five, she was one of the top fillies in the United States, scoring back-to-back wins in three important stakes races, which included equalling and breaking the Monmouth Park track record in the Matchmaker Stakes. Retired to broodmare duty, Politely produced eleven foals between 1971 and 1987. She was bred to top stallions such as Hoist The Flag, Dr. Fager, Alydar, The Minstrel, Smarten and Northern Dancer, but her offspring met with limited racing success In 1977 Politely was inducted into the Aiken Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame and into the Maryland Thoroughbred Hall of Fame in 2013.

His final match was a 3–0 loss to Sheffield Wednesday in League One. He also made six appearances on loan at Macclesfield Town in 2002. Sunderland After impressing in a three-day trial with Sunderland in November 2004, Welsh signed with the club for £15,000, and could have included a compensation for amount of time on the field stipulation to £35,000. Upon signing for Sunderland he was assigned the vacant number 11 shirt, and made his club debut on 1 January 2005 in a 3–2 defeat to Preston North End, replacing Marcus Stewart in the 68th minute. He scored two goals in eight appearances during the 2004–05 season for Sunderland. Welsh made his first start for Sunderland a week later on 8 January 2005, scoring a free kick in a 2–1 victory against Crystal Palace. Welsh went on to make eight appearances that season, scoring again, against QPR at Loftus Road on 2 April. After Sunderland's promotion to the Premier League, Welsh retained the number 11 shirt, starting the season in place of injured defender George McCartney. However, Welsh was controversially sent off in only the second game of the season against Liverpool at Anfield on 20 August 2005, although the decision was later overturned on appeal. Welsh found himself out of the Sunderland team after Christmas, and many thought he had played his last game for the club after he was loaned to Championship club Leicester on 1 March 2006. Welsh went on to make ten appearances for Leicester, scoring one goal, helping to stave off relegation for the Foxes. Four days after playing his last game for Leicester, Welsh was back at Sunderland, playing in the club's last two games, against Fulham and Aston Villa, under new caretaker manager Kevin Ball. Following the transfer of popular midfielder Julio Arca to Middlesbrough in the summer, Welsh was expected to start the season as first choice winger, however injury hit early on in pre-season. Welsh picked up an injury during a pre-season win against League of Ireland club, Shelbourne, prompting Quinn and new manager Roy Keane to sign Swedish winger Tobias Hysen and Celtic midfielder Ross Wallace to fill the left-midfield role. Welsh subsequently re-joined Leicester on loan when he regained fitness, although he managed only four league starts for them, and returned to Sunderland in the New Year. Coincidentally, Sunderland's next game was against Leicester at the Walkers Stadium, where Welsh was named as an unused substitute. Toronto After failing to break back into Sunderland's first team, it was announced in March 2007, that Welsh would be heading to Canada for a medical before signing a contract with Major League Soccer (MLS) club, Toronto, after the clubs agreed a deal to end his contract at Sunderland.

Blackpool On 30 August 2007, it was reported that Welsh would be leaving Toronto for Blackpool, whom he signed for the following day. During the 2007–08 season he made 21 appearances in the Championship, mostly as a substitute. On 7 May 2008 he was released by Blackpool. Yeovil Town In August 2008 Welsh went on trial at Football League One club Yeovil Town. On 3 September, Yeovil manager Russell Slade confirmed that the club had a verbal agreement to sign Welsh with him due to have a medical at the club the following day. Welsh signed a contract with the club until the end of the 2008–09 season. Welsh played 38 games for Yeovil in his first season, becoming a fans' favourite when the team went on a four-game winning streak scoring four goals direct from his set pieces. He ended the season with Yeovil's most assists (seven) and most crosses (80) in his 38 appearances. At the end of the 2008–09 season, Welsh signed a new two-year deal keeping him at the club until the summer of 2011. In the 2009–10 season Welsh started well and was the divisional top goal maker with seven assists. However, formation changes saw him slip out of the side, making most of his appearances from the subs bench. However, he was Yeovil's leading creator for the second consecutive season (10 assists), and he scored his first two goals for the club, in a 2–0 win over Brentford and a 4–1 win over Wycombe. Welsh scored in his second game of the 2010–11 season, against local rivals Exeter City, and against Tranmere Rovers two weeks later. Welsh was again one of Yeovil's outstanding performers, leading the way in assists. He secured Yeovil's league one status for another season with an 85th-minute equaliser at home to Oldham Athletic the day after his first child was born. At the end of the 2010–11 season, he and six other Yeovil players were told they would be re-signed. Carlisle United On 1 June 2011, Welsh became Greg Abbott's first signing of the summer when he joined Carlisle United on a two-year deal.

It is widespread across Europe, North Africa and temperate Asia. It is naturalized in Australia, New Zealand, Oregon, California and British Columbia. It is considered a noxious weed in some places. This species is a weed of rice fields in many areas, including New South Wales and California. In England and Wales it is occasionally locally found, in Ireland it is rare, and Scotland it is very rare. It is found in mud and in fresh waters. Description This is a perennial herb growing from a caudex in the water or mud that typically reaches a height of about 0.7 meters and a spread of 0.25 meters. It produces lance-shaped leaves 12 to 20 centimeters long and 4 wide on long petioles; leaves which remain submerged in water are smaller and less prominently veined. The inflorescence is mostly erect and up to half a meter tall. It produces a wide array of small pinkish-purple three-petalled flowers that open in the morning, from June until August. The fruit is a tiny achene up to 2 or 3 millimeters long clustered into an aggregate fruit of about 20 units. The seeds are reddish-brown and about 1.5 millimeters long. Cultivation Grows best in water 15-30 centimeters deep in full sun. Suitable for USDA hardiness zones 5–8. Similar Species The water plantain Alisma plantago-aquatica has acute leaf tips not tapering to a stalk. The flowers of A plantago-aquatica also typically open in the afternoon, and the leaves are wider.

The river flows through Francistown, where it is joined by the Ntshe (or Inchwe) River from the left. History About 1865 a hunter came across traces of old gold diggings near the Tati. He invited Karl Mauch to accompany him on his next trip, and in 1866 Mauch announced that he had found the Tati goldfields extending about which started the first gold rush in Southern Africa the following year. In 1869 the Englishman Daniel Francis came to hunt for gold on the river, before heading south to the Kimberley diamond fields in 1870. The gold was hard to extract, and the gold rush died down. Francis returned in 1880 and obtained mining rights from King Lobengula. Mining activity revived in the 1880s and 1890s, and Francistown was established in 1897 when the railway arrived. The town was named after Francis, who owned most of the land in the area. Use The sandy bed of the Tati river holds water only for a few days in each year, as is common with rivers in Botswana.

History The founding members were Shawn Brown (vocals) and Ramsey Metcalf (guitar), who later added Nathan Larson (bass), Alex Daniels (drums) and Jason Farrell (guitar). Before Swiz formed, Brown had been the original vocalist for Dag Nasty. Metcalf departed shortly after the band recorded its first demo and Swiz continued as a four-piece. Getting started The band started with the goal to move away from the Revolution Summer movement that had emerged with the Washington, D.C. punk scene in 1985. Members felt the intensity and aggressiveness had decreased with the new wave of punk music and felt they resonated more with hardcore punk. The band's first show together was on June 25, 1987 and did five more before deciding Ramsey was not a good fit. They proceeded to put out an E.P and begin touring. Releases They released its first 7\", Down, at the end of 1987 and its self-titled LP was released by Sammich Records in 1988. Swiz released its next album, Hell Yes, I Cheated, in 1989. The record also included a track by Fury, a side project that consisted of Farrell, Daniels, Brown (on bass), and Chris Thomson (formerly of Ignition, later of Circus Lupus), on vocals. By the time Hell Yes, I Cheated was released in 1990, Larson had left the band and was replaced by Dave Stern. This line-up recorded an EP in May 1990 but broke up shortly afterward. The EP, titled With Dave, was released posthumously in 1992 by Jade Tree Records. In 1993, Jade Tree also released No Punches Pulled, which contained the band's entire discography. Also that year, THD Records released a 7\" called Rejects, which contained unused tracks from the Down sessions. Recent History Nathan Larson resurfaced with Shudder To Think and later went into soundtrack work. Jason Farrell and Dave Stern formed Bluetip in 1995. After Bluetip's demise, Farrell formed Retisonic and is also a graphic designer whose work has appeared on many records by a number of different bands.

During his solo career he has issued five studio albums and worked on soundtracks for Australian films and television like The Man Who Sued God, Remote Area Nurse, Secret City, and The Circuit. Bridie is the founder and artistic director of Wantok Musik Foundation; a not-for-profit music label that records, releases and promotes culturally infused music from Indigenous Australia, Melanesia and Oceania. In 2019 he received the Don Banks Music Award. Biography David Bridie was born in 1962 and grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Deepdene with three siblings. He received training in classical music. From 1980 to 1983 Bridie provided keyboards for Misspent Youth, with James Southall on percussion. They travelled to Perth, after their lead singer convinced them they would earn more money. Bridie had dropped out of his Arts/Law degree course for the venture, but found that Perth bands performed cover versions due to \"the city's penchant for Top 40 and retro hits.\" They returned to Melbourne and he left the group soon after. He was also a member of Go Circus, alongside Rowan McKinnon on bass guitar. Bridie on vocals, piano, synthesiser and percussion formed a World music duo, Not Drowning, Waving in Melbourne in 1983 with fellow classical musician John Phillips on guitar. The pair had met at La Trobe University when Bridie invited Phillips to help record a track, \"Moving Around\", which had McKinnon",

Initially Not Drowning, Waving was a studio-only project while Bridie, McKinnon, Phillips and Southall formed a performance group, Easter, with Russel Bradley on drums and Tim Cole on lead vocals. \"Moving Around\" was issued as Not Drowning, Waving's debut single in April 1984. The duo followed with their debut album, Another Pond, in January 1985 via Rampant Records. It was produced by their Easter bandmate, Cole. Easter were performing shows around Melbourne and released their own single, \"Cheesecloth\", in August 1985. Some of its members joined Not Drowning, Waving and the two groups co-existed with almost the same line-up. Not Drowning, Waving started live shows, while Easter wound down and eventually disbanded. Bridie and Phillips also worked in screen music beginning with the soundtrack for a film documentary, Canoe Man, directed by Mark Worth. To research music for the documentary, Bridie had travelled to Rabaul, Papua New Guinea (PNG) in 1986 and first heard George Telek's \"amazing song coming out of a recording studio.\" He returned, with Not Drowning, Waving, to Rabaul in late 1988 to record their fifth album, Tabaran (1990). Aside from Telek they used other local musicians, and the album was co-credited to The Musicians of Rabaul, Papua New Guinea featuring Telek. They toured PNG together, including a concert at the nation's capital, Port Moresby, to an audience of 25000; and then they toured Australia. In late 1989 Helen Mountfort joined Not Drowning, Waving after having provided cello on a track on Tabaran. Bridie, with bandmates Bradley and Mountfort formed an acoustic strings-based side project, My Friend the Chocolate Cake, as a chamber pop group. Other founders were Andrew Caswell on mandolin, Hope Csutoros on violin and Andrew Richardson on guitar. They released a self-titled album in 1991 with Bridie co-producing alongside Mountfort, Carswell and Cole. Also in that year Not Drowning, Waving provided the soundtrack for comedy-drama film, Proof. Bridie and Mountfort worked with Jen Anderson on violin (ex-the Black Sorrows) and members of Hunters & Collectors' horn section on a feature film, Hammers Over the Anvil (1993), which was issued in the following year as a soundtrack album, Hammers, credited to Not Drowning, Waving. That group had released their sixth and last studio album, Circus, in 1993 and disbanded by the end of the year. AllMusic's Australian-based music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, observed that Bridie and Phillips' early work, \"sparked the duo's enthusiasm for the sort of free-form ambient soundscapes that would become the basis of their sound as the group Not Drowning Waving and lay the seeds for their interest in film music.\" Fellow Australian music historian, Ian McFarlane, noticed the influences of Brian Eno and David Byrne on the pair, but \"[they] were not averse to incorporating African and other Third World rhythms into their muse. Likewise, they placed an emphasis on natural acoustic and atmospheric dynamics rather than an electronic approach.\" My Friend the Chocolate Cake, with Bridie and Mountfort as mainstays, issued seven studio albums before the group took an indefinite hiatus from August 2018.

After My Friend the Chocolate Cake's debut album Bridie's further work as a record producer in the mid-1990s includes Archie Roach's Jamu Dreaming (1993), Paul Kelly's Wanted Man (1994) and Christine Anu's Stylin' Up (1995). He joined Anu's touring band in support of her album's release throughout 1995. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995 he was nominated for Producer of the Year. During 1998 he recorded a soundtrack album, In a Savage Land (November 1999), for a feature film of the same name, which was set and partly filmed on PNG's Trobriand Islands. He had collaborated with Musicians from the Trobriand Islands. His score received widespread critical acclaim, Andrew L. Urban of Urban Cinefile praised the film's \"unity of vision\", in using \"a wide palette of extraordinary music and sound.\" His work achieved multiple awards, Best Original Score at the 1999 AFI Awards, Best Music Score from the Film Critics Circle of Australia, and Best Original Soundtrack Album at the 2000 ARIA Awards. Upon reflection Bridie explained to Paris Pompor of FilmInk in 2017 why it was one of his favourite projects, \"[it] allowed me to soak in the Trobriand Islands' culture and stay in a beach shack for eight weeks recording anything that moved and learning about a fascinating part of the world. It was dark, cultural and layered and challenging and I had free rein.\" His first solo studio album, Act of Free Choice, appeared in May 2000, and \"was greeted with critical praise.\" The album's title refers to the Indonesian Act of Free Choice (1969), which was supported by a plebiscite on the incorporation of Western New Guinea into Indonesia. Bridie's Act of Free Choice reached the top 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Evan Cater of AllMusic rated it at three-out-of-five stars and explained, \"[he] finds new layers in his well-established gift for moody atmospherics\" although \"his breathy tenor can be slightly grating\", while \"his real strength lies in a compositional adventurousness.\" PopMatters Imran Khan determined, \"[he] created a new world of sound to explore, one that would define him as an artist as well as create a sonic visual that would allow the listener to enter that world and immerse himself in the emotional experience created from the album’s imagined realities.\" In 2019 he received the Don Banks Music Award. Discography Studio albums Compilation albums Soundtracks Over the years, David Bridie has balanced his career as a live musician with the composition of soundtrack music, with credits for over 100 feature films including Proof, Bran Nue Dae, The Man Who Sued God and Gone, several of which received International release.

His formal education ended abruptly, however, when someone threw an apple at a visiting dignitary, Sir Adam Beck, and knocked his silk top hat off his head.

At the outbreak of World War I, Hepburn had already enlisted in the 34th Fort Garry Horse but was unable to obtain his parents' consent to sign up for the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He then became a lieutenant in the 25th Elgin Regiment of the Canadian Militia, and was conscripted to the 1st (Western Ontario) Battalion in 1918. He transferred to the Royal Air Force and was sent to Deseronto for training but suffered injuries in an automobile accident that summer, followed by being bedridden by the influenza in the fall, both of which kept him from active service. He returned to St. Thomas to run his family's onion farm. Early political career After the war, Hepburn joined the United Farmers of Ontario (UFO) helping to start its branch in Elgin County, but by the mid-1920s he switched to the Liberal Party. In the 1926 election, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a representative of Elgin West, and was overwhelmingly re-elected in the 1930 election. Later that year he became leader of the Liberal Party of Ontario. His support of farmers and free trade, and his former membership in the UFO allowed him to attract Harry Nixon's rump of UFO Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) into the Liberal Party (as Liberal-Progressives). This and the Great Depression led to the defeat of the unpopular Conservative premier George Stewart Henry in the 1934 provincial election. His stance against the prohibition of alcohol allowed him to break the Liberal Party from the militant prohibitionist stance that had helped reduce it to a rural, Protestant south western Ontario rump in the 1920s. Hepburn represented a type of agrarian democracy that detested Toryism and valued oratory. He once saw a pile of manure situated in a village square, and proceeded to jump on top of it to give a speech, apologizing to the crowd for speaking from a Tory platform. He also used the same line when standing on a manure spreader, only to have a heckler shout, \"Well, wind 'er up Mitch, because she's never carried a bigger load!\" On his death, the Toronto Star observed: Premier of Ontario Hepburn's premiership achieved international attention, which merited his appearance on Time magazine's cover in 1937. As premier, Hepburn undertook a number of measures that enhanced his reputation as the practitioner of a highly vigorous style. In a public show of austerity, he closed Chorley Park, the residence of the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, auctioned off the chauffeur driven limousines that had been used by the previous Conservative cabinet, and fired many civil servants. To improve the province's welfare, he gave money to mining industries in Northern Ontario and introduced compulsory milk pasteurization (in so doing, he has been credited with virtually wiping out bovine tuberculosis in the province). Breaking with the temperance stance of previous Liberal governments, Hepburn expanded the availability of liquour by allowing hotels to sell beer and wine.

It was described by Labour Minister David Croll as \"the most controversial piece of legislation now on the Statute Books of the Province,\" and it came about after federal efforts that had been instituted under RB Bennett's \"New Deal\" were declared unconstitutional. Guardianship of Dionne quintuplets The government also made international news by making the Dionne quintuplets wards of the provincial Crown in response to public outrage of plans by promoters to exploit the infants by putting them on display at the Chicago World's Fair. The Legislative Assembly passed legislation in that regard and subsequently replaced it in 1944; it was not repealed until 2006. Tax collection As Treasurer of Ontario, Hepburn adopted a more aggressive approach in the collection of succession duty on large estates, which resulted in millions of dollars in extra government revenues. He made no apologies for doing so, as he noted in a speech in 1938: One estate that was of particular focus in this campaign was that of the late John Rudolphus Booth, who had died in 1925. Although succession duties of $4.28 million ($ in current terms) were paid in 1927, Hepburn subsequently claimed more in 1937 and had the Legislative Assembly of Ontario pass the necessary legislation to overcome the legal obstacles. Booth's heirs eventually paid another $3 million ($ in current terms) in 1939. Cancellation of Hydro contracts As part of his drive to cut government spending, the Power Commission Act, 1935, was passed to cancel contracts that the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario had signed between 1926 and 1930 for delivery of electricity from power plants in Quebec by declaring them to be \"void and unenforceable.\" The move temporarily shut Ontario out of world bond markets. The Act was declared to be ultra vires by the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1937 as being legislation in derogation of extraprovincial rights (although later jurisprudence has suggested that the Court may have overreached in its rulings). Many such contracts were later renegotiated at lower volumes and prices. Taking back forests Hepburn took an aggressive position with respect to timber licences in Northern Ontario that were being held by companies that would (or could) not cut wood on them. In that regard, in 1936 the Forest Resources Regulation Act was passed to grant the government broad powers for mandating minimum production quotas, maximum limits in line with good forestry practice, reduce licensed acreages that were in excess of requirements, and increase stumpage fees on companies \"operating or carrying on business in a manner detrimental to the public interest.\" Great Lakes Paper saw its holdings reduced from to , and was assessed a $500,000 penalty ($ in current terms) for refusing to participate in a minimum price agreement set up by the Ontario and Quebec governments.

When the Abitibi Power and Paper Company, in receivership since 1932, was ordered into liquidation in 1940, Hepburn appointed a Royal Commission to investigate the matter to determine the best course of resolution. The Legislative Assembly imposed a moratorium on liquidation proceedings in 1941, which was ultimately upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1943. The Commission's recommended plan was accepted by all creditors. It would emerge from receivership in 1946, after one of the longest such receiverships in Canadian history. Fight with CIO In later years, Hepburn would form a Liberal–Labour alliance with the Communist Party of Canada, but as premier, he opposed unions and refused to let the CIO form unions in Ontario. On April 8, 1937, the CIO-backed General Motors plant in Oshawa went on strike and demanded an eight-hour workday, a seniority system, and the recognition of its CIO-affiliated United Auto Workers union. The strikers were also supported by the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which was Canada's main left-wing party. Hepburn, then professing a deep concern about radicals among auto workers, was supported by the owners of the plant and General Motors when he organized a volunteer police force to help him put down the strike after Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King had refused to send the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The force was somewhat derisively known as \"Hepburn's Hussars\" or the \"Sons of Mitches.\" Cabinet ministers who disagreed with Hepburn over the issue were forced to resign. However, the strike held out, and Hepburn capitulated on April 23, 1937. Conflict with Mackenzie King Hepburn remained a bitter opponent of Mackenzie King after the strike and harshly criticized King's war effort in 1940, after the outbreak of World War II had caused a resolution in the legislature to be passed 44-10 to accuse the federal government of mishandling the war effort. The Conservative opposition voted unanimously for the resolution, but the motion split the governing Liberals, with nine members of Hepburn's caucus voting against and others leaving the chamber before the vote. Hepburn, thinking that Canada should be doing more to support the war, helped to organize the military districts in Ontario and encouraged men to volunteer when Mackenzie King chose not to introduce conscription. Hepburn supported King's opponent, Arthur Meighen, in a by-election in Toronto in 1942, despite Hepburn's later alliance with the Communist Party of Canada. Meighen's unusual source of support did not bring him to success, and he lost the by-election since the Liberals did not run a candidate, and King ordered party resources to be sent to the CCF candidate. However, King was politically much stronger than Hepburn; federal Liberal supporters, as well as those who thought an erratically-driven rift between the provincial and federal parties to be suicidal, called for him to step down.

Aftermath Although Gordon Daniel Conant had become premier, many people continued to think that was in name only. Senior cabinet ministers such as Provincial Secretary Harry Nixon resigned and demanded a leadership convention. Pressure from both provincial and federal Liberals caused one to be held in May 1943. Hepburn finally tendered his resignation as leader (by telegram), and Nixon was elected the new party leader and was appointed as premier. The Liberals under Nixon were soon routed in the 1943 Ontario election and fell to third-party status, behind the Progressive Conservatives, led by George Drew, and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, led by Ted Jolliffe. Hepburn himself was re-elected in his riding as an Independent Liberal while he was calling for a Liberal-Conservative coalition against the burgeoning CCF. The Liberal caucus unanimously asked Hepburn to resume the party's leadership in 1944. Now branding Drew's Conservatives as the greatest menace to Canada, he reversed his earlier criticism of Mackenzie King's war effort and campaigned for Liberal candidate General Andrew McNaughton in a 1945 federal by-election. Provincially, his earlier vehement doubts about radicals among auto workers now muted, Hepburn formed a Liberal-Labour alliance with the Communist Party of Canada (then known as the Labor-Progressive Party) for the 1945 Ontario election but lost his own seat in the legislature.

        "prompt": "forgiveness practices are performed on islands throughout the South Pacific, including Hawaii, Samoa, Tahiti and New Zealand. Traditional Hooponopono is practiced by Indigenous Hawaiian healers, often within the extended family by a family member. Polynesian antecedents In many Polynesian cultures, it is believed that a person's errors (called hara or hala) caused illness. Some believe error angers the gods, others that it attracts malevolent gods, and still others believe the guilt caused by error made one sick. \"In most cases, however, specific 'untie-error' rites could be performed to atone for such errors and thereby diminish one's accumulation of them.\" Among the islands of Vanuatu in the South Pacific, people believe that illness usually is caused by sexual misconduct or anger. \"If you are angry for two or three days, sickness will come,\" said one local man. The therapy that counters this sickness is confession. The patient, or a family member, may confess. If no one confesses an error, the patient may die. The Vanuatu people believe that secrecy is what gives power to the illness. When the error is confessed, it no longer has power over the person. Like many other islanders, including Hawaiians, people of Tikopia in the Solomon Islands, and on Rarotonga in the Cook Islands, believe that the sins of the father will fall upon the children. If a child is sick, the parents are suspected of quarreling or misconduct. In addition to sickness, social disorder could cause sterility of land or other disasters. Harmony could be restored only by confession and apology. In Pukapuka, it was customary to hold sort of a confessional over patients to determine an appropriate course of action in order to heal them. Similar traditions are found in Samoa, Tahiti, and among the Maori of New Zealand. Etymology \"Hooponopono\" is defined in the Hawaiian Dictionary as: (a) \"To put to rights; to put in order or shape, correct, revise, adjust, amend, regulate, arrange, rectify, tidy up make orderly or neat, administer, superintend, supervise, manage, edit, work carefully or neatly; to make ready, as canoemen preparing to catch a wave.\" (b) \"Mental cleansing: family conferences in which relationships were set right (hooponopono) through prayer, discussion, confession, repentance, and mutual restitution and forgiveness.\" Literally, hoo is a particle used to make an actualizing verb from the following noun. Here, it creates a verb from the noun pono, which is defined as: \"...goodness, uprightness, morality, moral qualities, correct or proper procedure, excellence, well-being, prosperity, welfare, benefit, true condition or nature, duty; moral, fitting, proper, righteous, right, upright, just, virtuous, fair, beneficial, successful, in perfect order, accurate, correct, eased, relieved; should, ought, must, necessary.\" Ponopono is defined as \"to put to rights; to put in order or shape, correct, revise, adjust, amend, regulate, arrange, rectify, tidy up, make orderly or neat.\" So hooponopono can be translated literally as \"to make right\" or \"to make good\".

        "prompt": "Hawaiian elders. Pukui first recorded her experiences and observations from her childhood (born 1895) in her 1958 book. Although the word hooponopono was not used, early Hawaiian historians documented a belief that illness was caused by breaking kapu, or spiritual laws, and that the illness could not be cured until the sufferer atoned for this transgression, often with the assistance of a praying priest (kahuna pule) or healing priest (kahuna lapaau). Forgiveness was sought from the gods or from the person with whom there was a dispute. Pukui described it as a practice of extended family members meeting to \"make right\" broken family relations. Some families met daily or weekly, to prevent problems from erupting. Others met when a person became ill, believing that illness was caused by the stress of anger, guilt, recriminations and lack of forgiveness. Kupuna Nana Veary wrote that when any of the children in her family fell ill, her grandmother would ask the parents, \"What have you done?\" They believed that healing could come only with complete forgiveness of the whole family. Ritual Hooponopono corrects, restores and maintains good relationships among family members and with their god(s) by getting to the causes and sources of trouble. Usually the most senior member of the family conducts it. He or she gathers the family together. If the family is unable to work through a problem, they turn to a respected outsider. The process begins with prayer. A statement of the problem is made, and the transgression discussed. Family members are expected to work problems through and cooperate, not \"hold fast to the fault\". One or more periods of silence may be taken for reflection on the entanglement of emotions and injuries. Everyone's feelings are acknowledged. Then confession, repentance and forgiveness take place. Everyone releases (kala) each other, letting go. They cut off the past (oki), and together they close the event with a ceremonial feast, called pani, which often included eating limu kala or kala seaweed, symbolic of the release. In a form used by the family of kahuna Makaweliweli of the island of Molokai, the completion of hooponopono is represented by giving the person forgiven a lei made from the fruit of the hala tree. Modern uses \"Aunty\" Malia Craver, who worked with the Queen Liliuokalani Children's Centers (QLCC) for more than 30 years, taught courses in traditional hooponopono. On August 30, 2000, she spoke about it to the United Nations. Traditional applications In the late 20th century, courts in Hawaii began to order juvenile and adult offenders to work with an elder who would conduct hooponopono for their families, as a form of alternative dispute resolution. The hooponopono is conducted in the traditional way, without court interference, with a practitioner picked by the family from a list of court-approved providers. Some native practitioners provide hooponopono to clients who otherwise might seek family counseling. Freedom from karma In 1976 Morrnah Simeona, regarded as a healing priest or kahuna lapaau, adapted the traditional hooponopono of family mutual forgiveness to the social realities of the modern day.

Simeona's version is influenced by her Christian (Protestant and Catholic) education and her philosophical studies about India, China and Edgar Cayce. Like Hawaiian tradition she emphasizes prayer, confession, repentance, and mutual restitution and forgiveness. Unlike Hawaiian tradition, she describes problems only as the effects of negative karma, saying that \"you have to experience by yourself what you have done to others.\" But that you are the creator of your life circumstances was common knowledge for the people of old as \"things we had brought with us from other lifetimes.\" Any wrongdoing is memorized within oneself and mirrored in every entity and object which was present when the cause happened. As the Law of Cause and Effect predominates in all of life and lifetimes, the purpose of her version is mainly \"to release unhappy, negative experiences in past reincarnations, and to resolve and remove traumas from the 'memory banks'.\" Karmic bondages hinder the evolution of mind, so that \"(karmic) cleansing is a requisite for the expansion of awareness\". Using her 14-step-process would dissolve those bondages. She did not use mantras or conditioning exercises. Her teachings include: there is a Divine Creator who takes care of altruistic pleas of Men; \"when the phrase 'And it is done' is used after a prayer, it means Man's work ends and God's begins.\" \"Self-Identity\" signifies, e.g. during the hooponopono, that the three selves or aspects of consciousness are balanced and connected with the Divine Creator. Different from egoistic prayers, \"altruistic prayers like hooponopono, where you also pray for the release of other entities and objects, reach the Divine plane or Cosmos because of their high vibrations. From that plane the Divine energy or \"mana\" would come,\" which would transform the painful part of the memory of the wrong actions in all participants to \"Pure Light\", on whatever plane they are existing; \"all are set free\". Through this transmutation in the mind the problems will lose their energy for physical effects, and healing or balancing is begun. In this sense, Simeona's mana is not the same as the traditional Polynesian understanding of mana. Pacifica Seminars, founded by Morrnah Simeona, started the first Ho'oponopono seminars in Germany. Seminars are still held on a regular basis in Germany, Poland, France, and Denmark. State of Zero After Simeona's death in 1992, her former student and administrator, Ihaleakala Hew Len, co-authored a book with Joe Vitale called Zero Limits referring to Simeona's Hooponopono teachings. Len makes no claim to be a kahuna. In contrast to Simeona's teachings, the book brings the new idea that the main objective of Hooponopono is getting to the \"zero state — it's where we have zero limits. No memories. No identity.\" To reach this state, which Len called 'Self-I-Dentity thru Ho'oponopono', includes using the mantra, \"I love you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you.\" It is based on Len's idea of 100% responsibility, taking responsibility for everyone's actions, not only for one's own. If",

History The original St. Joseph's Church was called San Jose de Guadalupe built on the site of the current basilica in 1803, and was the first non-mission parish built in California for the benefit of Spanish settlers instead of the Mission Indians (Ohlone). The Pueblo de San Jose de Guadalupe was connected with Mission Santa Clara by The Alameda which was part of the historic El Camino Real. The original adobe structure was damaged by earthquakes in 1818 and 1822. In 1835, prominent Californio businessman Antonio Suñol donated the land at the northeast corner of the Plaza del Pueblo (modern Plaza de César Chávez) for the construction of a new, larger adobe church. Suñol, alongside his brother-in-law Antonio María Pico (who served as Alcalde of San José at the time), oversaw the construction of the church for the next eight years until its completion and consecration in 1846.",

Early career Flicker's career began at age sixteen in Los Angeles when his band, The Zoo, was given a contract in 1968 by Bell Records (which later became Arista Records). They were one of the youngest groups ever signed to a major label at that time. The Zoo included Flicker on drums along with Howard Leese on guitar and keyboards. After relocating to Vancouver, British Columbia in 1971, Flicker was hired as chief engineer at Aragon Studios (later renamed Mushroom Studios), which became the premier state-of-the-art studio in western Canada. 1975 proved to be a fateful year for Flicker with his discovery, signing, and production of the band Heart. Flicker received the Canadian Juno Award for Producer of the Year for his production on Heart's debut album, Dreamboat Annie. Producer Flicker established himself as a major independent producer with artists that included Poco, Al Stewart, Randy Meisner, Nantucket, Wendy Waldman, Heart and Trooper, one of the five top-selling Canadian bands of all time.

Constructed in 1846 or 1847, it sank during a storm in Green Bay in 1864. It was salvaged in 1969 and moored in Menominee, Michigan, at the Mystery Ship Seaport, located in the Menominee River at the foot of Sixth Avenue. The ship was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1972 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974; Alvin Clark was removed from the National Register of Historic Places on June 10, 2020. Although the schooner was in pristine condition when raised, no plans were in place for its conservation, and the ship rapidly deteriorated. The remains of Alvin Clark were destroyed in 1994. Description Alvin Clark was a square stern lumber schooner measuring in length, with a beam of and a displacement of 218 tons. It was constructed primarily of white oak, with planking and -wide ribs. The ship had a single deck, two masts including a mainmast, and was rigged as a brigantine with a square foremast. Construction and operation Alvin Clark was built at the Bates and Davis Shipyard in Trenton, Michigan, in 1846 or 1847, likely by shipmaker John Clark, who had a son named Alvin. Clark, the original owner, used the Alvin Clark for shipping salt until he sold it in 1852. The second owner of the ship was Captain William M. Higgie of Racine, Wisconsin. The schooner spent the rest of its years shipping lumber to Chicago. On June 19, 1864, the ship was heading through Lake Michigan to Oconto, Wisconsin, to pick up a load of lumber, running empty under full sail. As it entered Green Bay, Captain Dunnin ordered the holds cleaned, and the hatches were removed. A sudden storm capsized the ship just off the shore of Chambers Island in Green Bay. Captain Dunnin, the mate, and another sailor were drowned; two other sailors were rescued. An attempt to salvage the ship was made a few months after the wreck, but it was unsuccessful and the Alvin Clark was left on the lakebed. Salvage In 1967, sport diver Frank Hoffman was hired by a commercial fisherman to free nets that had snagged on an \"unknown obstruction\" under the surface of Green Bay. Hoffman dove in and discovered the nets tangled in what appeared to be a ship's mast. Hoffman initially referred to the wreck as \"the Mystery Ship at 19 Fathoms\", but the ship proved to be the Alvin Clark, and was positively identified through a stencil made belowdecks by one of the sailors. The ship was completely intact and in excellent condition, and Hoffman secured the salvage rights the next year. He assembled a team that salvaged the ship, recovering artifacts and removing the silt from the wreck. Work began in the spring of 1968, and the team eventually brought the ship intact to the surface in July 1969.

Hoffman built a museum nearby and exhibited the ship as a tourist attraction at the \"Mystery Ship Seaport\" on Sixth Street in Menominee.

Deterioration and demolition Freed from the cold and low-oxygen waters at the bottom of the bay, Alvin Clark immediately started to deteriorate. Proceeds from the museum did not pay off Hoffman's incurred debt of $300,000, much less provide restoration funds. The ship eventually deteriorated beyond restoration. In 1985, an intoxicated Hoffman attempted to burn with kerosene what was left of the ship, but he was arrested and sentenced to a week in prison and a year of probation. In 1987, he sold the ship, now a hulk, to a group of local investors for $117,000. The investors moved and stabilized the ship, but they were not able to adequately preserve it. The ship was eventually found to be beyond saving and was declared a public hazard In 1994, the Mystery Ship Seaport and the remains of the Alvin Clark were demolished to make way for a parking lot.

The cathedral was completed in 1619 and was consecrated in 1640. It had two towers, but one collapsed in 1776 and was never rebuilt. In 1953, the cathedral was presented with \"The Golden Rose\" by Venerable Pope Pius XII.

It is placed on the tomb of St. Francis Xavier. The first Lithuanian Jesuit missionary in China, Andrius Rudamina, arrived in India in Goa on 22 August 1625. Almost 400 years later, 2015, a memorial stone bearing Andrius Rudamina's name was erected in the courtyard of Se Cathedral in Old Goa.

History Origins and A Mind's Portrait (2008–2010) Aeon Zen was founded in 2008 when Rich Gray and Lloyd Musto decided to form a new studio project. Unlike their previous bands, such as Timefall, which had a one-to-one correlation of members and instruments, Aeon Zen consisted of just the two members, with Musto playing drums and Gray on all other instruments and production. Vocal duties were, on their debut album, shared amongst guests. According to the band, the name Aeon Zen was chosen to portray an \"eternal state of bliss and enlightenment\", although the use of Aeon as an adjective is a non-standard construction. Writing and recording for their first album started in late 2008 and took roughly two months to complete, with both writing and recording occurring simultaneously. Several of the songs on A Mind's Portrait were written several weeks before the album was released, with Gray composing the majority of the material. Following the completion of the album, the band was signed to the record label Time Divide Records Ltd. in November 2008. This signing, and subsequent likelihood of an album release, helped in the conscription of the necessary guest vocalists such as Nils K. Rue of Pagan's Mind and Andi Kravljaca of Silent Call (ex Seventh Wonder), among others. The album was finally released on 1 May 2009. Artwork for the album was designed by Mattias Norén, who had previously undertaken work for groups such as Outworld, Evergrey and Into Eternity, among others. Shortly after the album release, Lloyd Musto left the band to pursue other projects. As of 2009, Rich was working on a 2nd album, as well as putting together a live band and rehearsing with session musicians to tour and play shows. The Face of the Unknown and Live Band (2010–2013) In July 2010 the band played their first live gig at the Luminaire in London, a performance that was praised for its high fidelity sound but critiqued for the undersized venue. During this time, Gray had been working on a follow-up album and, on 5 August 2010, he announced that The Face of the Unknown would be released on 12 October of the same year under the Time Divide label. Guest vocalists announced included Michael Eriksen (Circus Maximus), Andi Kravljaca (Silent Call), Nick D'Virgilio (Spock's Beard), Jem Godfrey (Frost*) and Jonny Tatum (Eumeria). Artwork for the album was, once again, designed by Mattias Norén. In early 2011 the band announced that they were embarking on a 23-date European tour with The Devin Townsend Project, spanning the UK, Germany, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands, among others.

On 24 September 2021, Aeon Zen released their final studio album, Transversal, consisting of one single 30-minute song split across 10 different tracks. The song was composed as a tribute to the band's whole career, with the artwork referencing all previous albums. Musical style and critical response Aeon Zen's music has been described as transcending stylistic and generic boundaries, moving from soft to heavy and defying categorization as purely metal, rock, progressive or even classical. A fusion of \"many stylistic elements\", Aeon Zen's music, as exhibited on A Mind's Portrait, includes \"catchy melodies\", \"a diverse mix of songs and styles\", and \"progressive time changes\" which \"run through the gamut of emotions\". In terms of comparison, many reviewers have noted their affinity with others in the Progressive Metal field, notably Dream Theater, Queensrÿche and Symphony X. The main departure from these groups is in the montage of styles presented on the album. Some reviewers felt that the \"multiplicity of ideas\" could be too overbearing for listeners unfamiliar with a new group, or even that such an overloading led to an overall \"incoherence\" on the album. Other reviewers felt that, rather than being a sign of weakness, it was a commendable feat to have enlisted the vocal services of so many prominent artists within the field. Nevertheless, the band felt obliged to counter these assertions by stating that the intermixture of styles is exactly the effect that was intended: Furthermore, in a video interview, Rich Gray stated that \"[on A Mind's Portrait] you even have piano ballads, there's even an orchestral track (mixed in with heavier progressive rock and metal tracks). Vocally, there's everything ranging from operatic power metal style singing, all the way to death metal growling. Nothing is out of the question\" However, even those critics who believed the band were yet to find their \"musical identity\", praised the album as a bold statement of intent, particularly given the young age of the musicians.

History In 1972, a completely hairless bitch pup was whelped in a litter of purebred Rat Terriers owned by Willie and Edwin Scott of Louisiana. Named Josephine, the bitch conformed to the Rat Terrier type in every way except for her coat, so the Scotts bred from her and her first litter produced another hairless bitch pup, Gypsy. Neither bitch whelped another hairless pup in multiple litters until, in 1981 at the age of nine, Josephine produced two more hairless pups, a dog and a bitch. In 1983 the dog, Snoopy, was mated to his hairless sisters and many more hairless pups were whelped, establishing the foundation stock for the new breed. Originally registered as a hairless variety of Rat Terriers, eventually the Scotts adopted a different breed name for their unique line and established a separate breed club, the American Hairless Terrier Association. In 2004 the United Kennel Club recognised the line as a breed and in 2016 the American Kennel Club also recognised the breed. Description According to the United Kennel Club’s breed standard, American Hairless Terriers typically stand between ; the breed typically weighs between . The breed has pricked ears and can be born with either a naturally short tail or a long tail that is never docked. At birth American Hairless Terriers are born with a light fuzz of hair over their entire body which they gradually shed from the nose backwards until they are entirely naked, this typically occurs by the age of six weeks; they retain eyebrows and whiskers. The breed standard states hairless examples’ skin can be any color, although they are usually part colored with freckles that enlarge with age. Because of their lack of hair, the breed is particularly susceptible to hypothermia in cold weather as well as sunburn in sunny conditions. Some American Hairless Terriers are whelped with coats; they are still recognised as examples of the breed The breed standard states coated examples of the breed have a short and dense coat that can be solid white or bi-color, tri-color, sable and brindle, always with some white.

Life Münster was born and grew up in Sankt Wendel in Saarland, Germany. In 1912 she moved to Düsseldorf and enrolled in an art school. She took lessons from the artists Otto Weil and Richard Wenzel until 1919, when she moved to Halle and studied until 1920 at the Leipzig Academy of Visual Arts. After that she studied until 1922 at the School of Applied Arts in Munich (now part of the Academy of Fine Arts). During this period she worked for various magazines as well as for the \"Moewe-Filmverlag\", a cartoon studio. In 1924 Münster obtained a teaching position at the newly founded State School of Arts and Crafts (Staatliche Schule für Kunst und Kunstgewerbe), now \"Saar College of Visual Arts\" in Saarbrücken. Over the following two years she studied at the Reimann School in Berlin, a private academy for decoration and commercial art. She returned to Sankt Wendel from 1926 to 1928, and then back to Berlin until 1932. Subsequently, she returned home to Sankt Wendel again where she finally settled and worked as a free-lance artist. From 1940 on she traveled widely in Lorraine, Italy, Spain and in various regions of France, from which she acquired influences for her painting. Mia Münster died at age 76 in 1970 in Sankt Wendel. Work Münster belonged to the generation of artists popularly termed the lost generation, born roughly between 1890 and 1910. These artists received little or no respect in the art world in the period after World War II because abstract art was fashionable and older artists, who still worked in figurative style, were mostly ignored. During her time in Berlin and Munich Münster made her living producing commercial art. She drew fashion illustrations and prepared designs and drawings for German entertainment magazines and satirical publications. In addition she produced illustrations for extravagant costumes and clothing for the special occasions which were popular in the \"Golden Twenties\". Münster captured the spirit of the times, marked initially by exuberance and later by insecurity and impoverishment, in many drawings, watercolors, and sketches. After she had finally settled in Sankt Wendel she devoted herself to other themes. Her cycle of paintings Lorraine Images (Lothringer",

The Act includes an emissions target, set for the year 2050, for a reduction of at least 80% from the baseline year, 1990. Annual targets for greenhouse gas emissions must also be set, after consultation the relevant advisory bodies. Provisions are included in the Act for the creation of a Scottish Committee on Climate Change, as at present the only advisory body is the UK-wide Committee on Climate Change. Ministers in parliament must now report on the progress of these targets. As of January 2011, public sector bodies in Scotland must comply with new guidelines set out by the Scottish Government.

The Principio Iron Works were started here in 1719 by Joseph Farmer with British capital and an ironmaster, John England, who made it one of the most successful in the colonial ironworks by the 1740s, producing pig iron for sale in London. Thomas Russell, Jr., England's successor, produced cannonballs for the Continental Army during the Revolution. The works were part of the (larger) Principio Company, whose other holdings included the Accokeek or Potomac Ironworks on the land of George Washington's father, Augustine Washington (north of Ferry Farm near Fredericksburg, Virginia). This works was developed by the ironmaster England originally as a source of iron ore. As early as 1726, it may have included a cold blast charcoal furnace. Accokeek/Potomac served as the headquarters of the Principio Company until it was closed sometime in the mid-1750s. The Maryland works were burnt by British forces in 1813. In 1836, the site and its ruined buildings were purchased by Joseph Whitaker, his brothers George Price Whitaker and Joseph Whitaker II, and partners Thomas Garrett (a prominent abolitionist) and William Chandler. The site still had water power; more importantly, it was crossed by the freshly laid tracks of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad. (Chandler was a director of the company.) The investors rebuilt the iron works and resumed production, opening a new blast furnace in 1837 and other improvements over the decades. Before the Civil War, the Whitakers divided their holdings geographically, with Joseph receiving the Pennsylvania properties and George Price the Maryland and Virginia ones. George Price Whitaker and his descendants continued to be involved in the iron and steel business; their holdings became part of the Wheeling Steel Company in 1921, and eventually of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel. The site produced iron until 1925. Part of the stone furnace still remains on the site. In 1972, Principio Furnace was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Set in a remote Irish castle called Dromore Castle, County Limerick, High Spirits is a topsy-turvy comedy with thematic leanings towards Ireland's rich folklore regarding ghosts and spirits, where the castle starts to come to life with the help of such denizens. Plot Cash-strapped Peter Plunkett owns a dilapidated Irish castle that he has converted to a bed and breakfast. Owing money to an Irish-American businessman named Brogan, Plunkett attempts to turn the castle into \"the most haunted castle in Europe\" for the tourist trade. Inspired by his mother's stories about the castle being haunted, he and his wacky Irish staff set about creating ghostly costumes and effects for their first group of American guests. Initially annoyed by the inept \"hauntings\", the American guests soon discover that Castle Plunkett's real ghosts have taken umbrage at being cheaply exploited and have staged a full-scale paranormal event. Two ghosts, Mary Plunkett and Martin Brogan, become romantically entangled with two of the American guests. This romantic twist becomes the main focus of the plot.

The conception of Egypt as the Two Lands was an example of the dualism in ancient Egyptian culture and frequently appeared in texts and imagery, including in the titles of Egyptian pharaohs. The Egyptian title zmꜣ-tꜣwj (Egyptological pronunciation sema-tawy) is usually translated as \"Uniter of the Two Lands\" and was depicted as a human trachea entwined with the papyrus and lily plant. The trachea stood for unification, while the papyrus and lily plant represent Lower and Upper Egypt. Standard titles of the pharaoh included the prenomen, quite literally \"Of the Sedge and Bee\" (nswt-bjtj, the symbols of Upper and Lower Egypt) and \"lord of the Two Lands\" (written nb-tꜣwj). Queens regnant were addressed as pharaohs and male. Queens consort might use a feminine versions of the second title, \"lady of The Two Lands\" (nbt-tꜣwj), \"mistress of the Entire Two Lands\" (hnwt-tꜣwy-tm), and \"mistress of the Two Lands\" (hnwt-tꜣwy). Structure Ancient Egypt was divided into two regions, namely Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. To the north was Lower Egypt, where the Nile stretched out with its several branches to form the Nile Delta. To the south was Upper Egypt, stretching to Aswan. The terminology \"Upper\" and \"Lower\" derives from the flow of the Nile from the highlands of East Africa northwards to the Mediterranean Sea. The two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt were united c. 3000 BC, but each maintained its own regalia: the hedjet or White Crown for Upper Egypt and the deshret or Red Crown for Lower Egypt. Thus, the pharaohs were known as the rulers of the Two Lands, and wore the pschent, a double crown, each half representing sovereignty of one of the kingdoms. Ancient Egyptian tradition credited Menes, now believed to be the same as Narmer, as the king who united Upper and Lower Egypt. On the Narmer Palette, the king is depicted wearing the Red Crown on one scene and the White crown in another, and thereby showing his rule over both Lands.

Sometimes, the duality is further extended by having the knotted plants extend and bind foreign foes (both from the North and the South) as well. During the first dynasty, dualistic royal titles emerge, including the King of Upper and Lower Egypt (nswt bjtj) title which combines the plant representing Upper Egypt and a bee representing Lower Egypt. The other dualistic title is the Two Ladies name or Nebty name. The two ladies are Nekhbet, the vulture goddess associated with Nekhen in Upper Egypt, and Wadjet, the cobra goddess associated with Buto in Lower Egypt. There are many depictions of the ritual unifications of the Two Lands. It is not known if this was perhaps a rite that would have been enacted at the beginning of a reign, or merely a symbolic representation. Many of the depictions of the unification show two gods binding the plants. Often the gods are Horus and Set, or on occasion Horus and Thoth. There are several examples of Barque stands from the reigns of Amenhotep III (Hermopolis), Taharqa (Jebel Barkal), and Atlanersa (Jebel Barkal) that show two river gods performing the rite. This matches a scene from the Temple at Abu Simbel from the time of Ramesses II. There are only a handful of scenes that show the King himself performing the ritual. All of these are from barque stands and date to the reigns of Amenhotep III, Seti I and Ramesses III The latter two may be copies of the first one.

Background Between 10 July 2007 – 20 May 2011, 45 attacks on Islamic buildings and Muslims were recorded all over Bulgaria, including an attack on four women for wearing hijab and three other separate attacks in which three Muslims (including a child) were injured in Sofia, Dobrich, and Plovdiv. Previous attacks on Banya Bashi mosque: · Vandalizing the mosque with hate speech on 20.05.2010; · Attacking a worshipper and chanting hate slogans on 06.11.2010 · Playing Christian chants during the sala (this act was led by ATAKA as well) to “noise the terror” The incident The events took place just one day after the traditional commemoration of the May protests and the expulsion of 360,000 Turks from Bulgaria in the summer of 1989 and shortly before the Bulgarian elections. Muslims gathered for Friday prayers at the city's only mosque. Since the mosque can accommodate up to 700 people (while the city has 30,000 Muslims) the remaining worshipers were forced to perform their worship in the temple courtyard. The rally started one day after the protesters got permission from the municipality to organize a protest and announced the theme \"protest against the loudspeakers of the mosque\". According to reports, the initial idea was to protest next to the park, close to the mosque. But later, due to the request of Volen Siderov, the protesters moved right in front of the shrine. It was not the first time in which Siderov led a campaign against the mosque’s loudspeakers. In 2006, he gathered 35,000 signatures for the removal of the device, and another protest against the “howling” was organized, although the noise always has been adjusted to the level of urban noise. At the very beginning, the ATAKA supporters started to shout “Turkish stooges”, “scum”, “cut-offs”, “off to Ankara”, “your feet stink, that's why you wash them” etc. One supporter cut a fes, a traditional hat, with a knife and said “we shall now show you what will happen to each one of you! The Muslims kept their composure while the imam asked all the believers from the loudspeaker not to give in to provocations and to trust the police. During the clashes, the nationalists used wooden flagpoles, metal pipes, eggs, and stones to attack the worshippers, and the last used plastic tubing. Five Muslims and five police officers were injured. Denitsa Gadzheva was the only protestor who was wounded. Her injury was caused by a stone however since the Muslims didn't use stones, it is unknown who was responsible for the wound. Reactions The incident was criticized by Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan . Many Bulgarians brought flowers to the mosque, as an apology for the incident.

Social control is described as a certain set of rules and standards in society that keep individuals bound to conventional standards as well as to the use of formalized mechanisms. The disciplinary model was the forerunner to the control model. History of the term The term \"social control\" was first introduced to sociology by Albion Woodbury Small and George Edgar Vincent in 1894; however, at the time, sociologists only showed sporadic interest in the subject. Some social philosophers have played a role in the development of social control such as Thomas Hobbes in his work Leviathan that discusses social order and how the state exerts this using civil and military power; as well as Cesare Beccaria's On Crimes and Punishments that argues that people will avoid criminal behavior if their acts result in harsher punishment, stating that changes in punishment will act as a form of social control. Sociologist Émile Durkheim also explored social control in the work The Division of Labour in Society and discusses the paradox of deviance, stating that social control is what makes us abide by laws in the first place. Society uses certain sanctions to enforce a standard of behavior that is deemed socially acceptable. Individuals and institutions utilize social control to establish social norms and rules, which can be exercised by peers or friends, family, state and religious organizations, schools, and the workplace. The goal of social control is to maintain order in society and ensure conformity in those who are deemed deviant or undesirable in society. Sociologists identify two basic forms of social control: Informal means of control – Internalization of norms and values by a process known as socialization, which is \"the process by which an individual, born with behavioral potentialities of enormously wide range, is led to develop actual behavior which is confined to the narrower range of what is acceptable for him by the group standards\".<ref>Lindzey, Gardner (Ed), (1954).

        "prompt": "theorists, such as Émile Durkheim, refer to this form of control as regulation. As briefly defined above, the means to enforce social control can be either informal or formal. Sociologist Edward A. Ross argues that belief systems exert a greater control on human behavior than laws imposed by government, no matter what form the beliefs take. Social control is considered one of the foundations of order within society. Definition of the concept Roodenburg identifies the concept of social control as a classical concept. While the concept of social control has been around since the formation of organized sociology, the meaning has been altered over time. Originally, the concept simply referred to society's ability to regulate itself. However, in the 1930s, the term took on its more modern meaning of an individual's conversion to conformity. Academics began to study Social control theory as a separate field in the early 20th century. The concept of social control is related to the notion of social order, which is identified as existing in the following areas of society: The education system Policing and the law Psychiatry Social work The welfare state The working environment The term social control has also been linked to the term delinquency, defined as deviancy, which is the violation of established mores, social norms, and laws. More serious acts of delinquency are defined as consensus crimes and conflict crimes that are determined by society and the law to inhibit unwanted or negative behavior as a form of social control. Informal Social values Social values are result of an individual internalizing certain norms and values. Social values present in individuals are products of informal social control, exercised implicitly by a society through particular customs, norms, and mores. Individuals internalize the values of their society, whether conscious or not of the indoctrination. Traditional society relies mostly on informal social control embedded in its customary culture to socialize its members. The internalization of these values and norms is known as a process called socialization. Sanctions Informal sanctions may include shame, ridicule, sarcasm, criticism, and disapproval, which can cause an individual to stray towards the social norms of the society. In extreme cases sanctions may include social discrimination and exclusion. Informal social control usually has more effect on individuals because the social values become internalized, thus becoming an aspect of the individual's personality. Informal sanctions check \"deviant\" behavior. An example of a negative sanction comes from a scene in the film Pink Floyd – The Wall, whereby the young protagonist is ridiculed and verbally abused by a high school teacher for writing poetry in a mathematics class. Another example from the movie About a Boy, when a young boy hesitates to jump from a high springboard and is ridiculed for his fear. Though he eventually jumps, his behavior is controlled by shame. Reward and punishment Informal controls reward or punish acceptable or unacceptable behavior (i.e., deviance) and are varied from individual to individual, group to group, and society to society.

        "prompt": "is inappropriate to flirt with the minister. In a criminal gang, on the other hand, a stronger sanction applies in the case of someone threatening to inform to the police of illegal activity. Social control by use of reward is known as positive reinforcement. In society and the laws and regulations implemented by the government tend to focus on punishment or the enforcing negative sanctions to act as a deterrent as means of social control. Theoretical bias within the modern media Theorists such as Noam Chomsky have argued that systemic bias exists in the modern media. The marketing, advertising, and public relations industries have thus been said to utilize mass communications to aid the interests of certain political and business elites. Powerful ideological, economic and religious lobbyists have often used school systems and centralized electronic communications to influence public opinion. Formal Sanctions Formal sanctions are usually imposed by the government and organizations in the form of laws to reward or punish behavior. Some formal sanctions include fines and incarceration in order to deter negative behavior. Other forms of formal social control can include other sanctions that are more severe depending on the behavior seen as negative such as censorship, expulsion, and limits on political freedom. Examples of this can be seen in law. If a person breaks a law set forth by the government and is caught, they will have to go to court and depending on the severity, will have to pay fines or face harsher consequences. According to a study done on crime in cities, in cities that have a higher incarceration rate and those that police make more arrests for public offenses, tend to have lower crime rates and incarceration rates. Historically Social control developed together with civilization, as a rational measure against the uncontrollable forces of nature which tribal organisations were at prey to within archaic tribal societies. Criminal persecutions first emerged around sixth century B.C. as a form of formal social control in Athens, Greece. The purpose of these persecutions were to check certain groups and protect them from malicious interests. Rulers have used legitimized torture as a means of mind control, as well as murder, imprisonment and exile to remove from public space anyone the state authorities deemed undesirable. In the Age of Enlightenment, harsh penalties for crimes and civil disobedience were criticized by philosophers such as Cesare Beccaria and Jeremy Bentham, whose work inspired reform movements. These movements eventually led to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, which informs most western jurisdictions and the similar Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam in 1990. The word crime became part of the vocabulary of the English language via Old French, during the Middle Ages, and within the Middle English phase of the language. In history, religion provided a moral influence on the community and each person, providing an internal locus of control oriented toward a morality, so that each person was empowered to have a degree of control over themselves within society.

Nevertheless, within the twentieth century, social scientists presumed that religion was still a principal factor of social control. Comte, and those who preceded him, were breathing the air of a revolution in the latter part of the eighteenth century (French Revolution) to bring about a so-called enlightened way of being in society, which brought about a new liberty for the individual, without the constraints of an over-seeing aristocracy. In the context social control through penal and correctional services, the rehabilitative ideal (Francis Allen 1964) is a key idea that formed within the 20th century—the first principle of which is that behavior is first caused by things that happened before (\"Human behaviour is a product of antecedent causes\"). The idea was later thought to have less relevancy to the philosophy and exaction or execution of correctional measures, at least according to a 2007 publication (and elsewhere). Techniques Law is a technique used for the purposes of social control. For example, there are certain laws regarding appropriate sexual relationships; these are largely based on societal values. Historically, homosexuality has been criminalised in the West. In modern times, due to shifts in societal values, Western societies have mostly decriminalized homosexual relations. However, there are still laws regarding age of consent and incest, as these are still deemed as issues in society that require means of control. A mechanism of social control occurs through the use of selective incentives. Selective incentives are private goods, which are gifts or services, made available to people depending on whether they do or don't contribute to the good of a group, collective, or the common good. If people do contribute, they are rewarded, if they don't they are punished. Mancur Olson gave rise to the concept in its first instance (c.f. The Logic of Collective Action''). Oberschall, in his work, identifies three elements to the pragmatics of social control as they exist in our current society. These are, confrontational control, such as riot control and crowd control, preventative measures to deter non-normal behaviors, which is legislation outlining expected boundaries for behavior, and measures complementary to preventative measures, which amount to punishment of criminal offences. Cities can implement park exclusion orders (prohibiting individuals from frequenting some or all of the parks in a city for an extended period due to a previous infraction), trespass laws (privatizing areas generally thought of as public so police can choose which individuals to interrogate), and off-limit orders (Stay Out of Drug Areas (SODA) and Stay Out of Areas of Prostitution (SOAP) that obstruct access to these spaces). These are just a few of the new social control techniques cities use to displace certain individuals to the margins of society. Several common themes are apparent in each of these control mechanisms. The first is the ability to spatially constrain individuals in their own city. Defying any of the above statutes is a criminal offense resulting in possible incarceration. Though not all individuals subjected to an exclusion order obey it, these individuals are, at the very least,",

Homeless individuals generally frequent parks since the area provides benches for sleeping, public washrooms, occasional public services, and an overall sense of security by being near others in similar conditions. Privatizing areas such as libraries, public transportation systems, college campuses, and commercial establishments that are generally public gives the police permission to remove individuals as they see fit, even if the individual has ethical intent in the space. Off-limit orders attempting to keep drug addicts, prostitutes, and others out of concentrated areas of drug and sex crimes commonly restricts these individuals' ability to seek social services beneficial to rehabilitation, since these services are often located within the SODA and SOAP territories. Broken windows theory in the United States In the United States, early societies were able to easily expel individuals deemed undesirable from public space through vagrancy laws and other forms of banishment. In the 1960s and 1970s, however, these exclusion orders were denounced as unconstitutional in America and consequently were rejected by the US Supreme Court. The introduction of broken windows theory in the 1980s transformed the concepts cities used to form policies, to circumvent the previous issue of unconstitutionality. According to the theory, the environment of a particular space signals its health to the public, including to potential vandals. By maintaining an organized environment, individuals are dissuaded from causing disarray in that particular location. However, environments filled with disorder, such as broken windows or graffiti, indicate an inability for the neighborhood to supervise itself, therefore leading to an increase in criminal activity. Instead of focusing on the built environment, policies substantiated by the Broken Windows Theory overwhelmingly emphasize undesirable human behavior as the environmental disorder prompting further crime. The civility laws, originating in the late 1980s and early 1990s, provide an example of the usage of this latter aspect of the Broken Windows Theory as legitimization for discriminating against individuals considered disorderly in order to increase the sense of security in urban spaces. These civility laws effectively criminalize activities considered undesirable, such as sitting or lying on sidewalks, sleeping in parks, urinating or drinking in public, and begging, in an attempt to force the individuals doing these and other activities to relocate to the margins of society. Not surprisingly then, these restrictions disproportionally affect the homeless. Individuals are deemed undesirable in urban space because they do not fit into social norms, which causes unease for many residents of certain neighborhoods. This fear has been deepened by the Broken Windows Theory and exploited in policies seeking to remove undesirables from visible areas of society. In the post-industrial city, concerned primarily with retail, tourism, and the service sector, the increasing pressure to create the image of a livable and orderly city has no doubt aided in the most recent forms of social control. These new techniques involve even more intense attempts to spatially expel certain individuals from urban space since the police are entrusted with considerably more power to",

Recent developments In the decades leading up to the end of the 1980s, an increased prevalence of the individual as a feature within society led to many new therapies, suggesting the use of therapy as a means of social control (Conrad & Scheider, 1980: Mechanic 1989).

Cultural politics Political science terminology SurveillanceStereotypes of American people (here meaning citizens of the United States) can today be found in virtually all cultures. They are often manifest in America's own television and in the media's portrayal of the United States as seen in other countries, but can also be spread by literature, art, and public opinion. Not all of the stereotypes are equally popular, nor are they all restricted to Americans; and although most can be considered negative, a few assign neutral, positive or admiring qualities to the stereotypical U.S. citizen. Many of the ethnic stereotypes collide with otherwise unrelated political anti-Americanism. Stereotypes with positive use Generosity According to American William Bennett a positive stereotype of Americans is that they are very generous. The United States sends aid and supplies to many countries, and Americans may be seen as people who are charitable or volunteer. Alexis de Tocqueville first noted in 1835 the American attitude towards helping others in need. A 2010 Charities Aid Foundation study found that Americans were the fifth most willing to donate time and money in the world at 55%. Total charitable contributions in 2010 were higher in the US than in any other country. Optimism Americans may be seen as very positive and optimistic people. Optimism is seen as the driving force behind achievement of the American Dream. Hardworking nature Americans may be stereotyped as hardworking people, whether in their jobs or other matters. Frontier mentality Traits such as engaging in risky exploration to secure food and territory favored early Americans, as well as the willingness to move one's life in pursuit of goals such as personal freedom and economic affluence. These traits may have distilled over time into an individualism characterized by toughness and self-reliance. Friendliness Americans have been seen as friendly, talkative, and open to conversation. Stereotypes with negative use Obsession with guns The United States has a historical fondness for guns, and this is often portrayed in American media. A considerable percentage of Americans own firearms, and the United States has some of the developed world's highest death rates caused by firearms. A 2018 article attributed the high death rates to mass shootings or inner city violence, but the murder rate in America was then on a decline, and it appeared that suicide by firearm is a large contributor to the \"gun-deaths\" statistic.

        "prompt": "American mass shootings, making these incidents well known internationally despite the fact that these kind of killings account for an extremely small portion of the firearms death rate. In 2007, the United States was ranked number one in gun ownership with a rate of 88.8 guns per 100 residents. In 2017, the United States again ranked number one in gun ownership with a rate of 120.5 guns per 100 citizens. Materialism, over-consumption, and extreme capitalism A common stereotype of Americans is that of economic materialism and capitalism. They may be seen as caring most about money, judging all things by their economic value, and scorning those of lower socioeconomic status. However, the US has long been considered to be one of the most charitable nations in the world by a wide margin. Americans are extremely charitable by global standards: according to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest in the world by a large margin. Lack of cultural awareness Americans may be stereotyped as ignorant of countries and cultures beyond their own. This stereotype shows them as lacking intellectual curiosity, thus making them ignorant of other cultures, places, or lifestyles outside of the United States. The idea of American students dumbing down is attributed to the declining standards of American schools and curricula. Racism and racialism American people in general may be portrayed as racist or racialist, often discriminating against their minorities. Racism had a significant presence in American history and is still relevant today. According to Albert Einstein, racism is America's \"worst disease\". In a 2017 survey, 58% of Americans said that racism is a \"big problem in our society\". Environmental ignorance Americans may be seen as reckless and imprudent people regarding the preservation of the environment. They may be portrayed as lavish, driving high polluting SUVs and unconcerned about climate change or global warming. The United States (whose population is 327 million) has the second-highest carbon dioxide emissions after China (whose population is 1.4 billion), is one of the few countries which did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, and is one of just three countries to refuse to participate in the Paris Agreement after its withdrawal from the agreement in June 2017. In the context of stereotyping, it is perhaps more relevant to look at production per capita; the USA compares favorably with oil-producing nations in the Middle East, with Qatar at 40.3 metric tons per capita versus the United States' 17.6 metric tons per capita, though they are behind most European countries. Germany, for instance, emits only 9.1 metric tons per capita. However, the United States has reduced their energy-related greenhouse gas emissions by 12% from 2005 to 2018 while, in the same time period, the world's energy-related emissions have increased by 24%. Arrogance and nationalism Americans are often stereotyped as arrogant people. They are frequently depicted in foreign media as excessively nationalistic and obnoxiously patriotic, believing the United States is better than all other countries and patronizing foreigners. Americans may be seen by people of other",

        "prompt": "as arrogant and egomaniacal. In 2009, then-U.S. President Barack Obama said that the United States has \"shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive\" towards its allies. Military zeal Another common stereotype is that Americans want to be \"the world's policemen\", believing that the entire world needs their help – even if this results in preemptive military intervention – because they are somehow exceptional. This relatively recent stereotype spawned from Cold War and post-Cold War military interventions such as the Vietnam War and Iraq War, which many people opposed. The United States is also stereotyped being a country with Hero syndrome in foreign media. The Hero syndrome manifests itself when the protagonist suffering the syndrome creates supposed, implied or ostensible crises only to eventually resolve them thereby becoming the savior of the day, the hero of the moment. American militarism is lampooned in several works, including the satirical film Team America: World Police. Workaholic culture While the stereotype of hard-working Americans is often a positive one, the United States has also been criticized in recent years as a workaholic culture. In The Huffington Post, Tijana Milosevic, a Serbian who had traveled to Washington, D.C. for a degree, wrote, \"In fact my family and friends had observed that I shouldn’t have chosen America, since I would probably feel better in Western Europe — where life is not as fast paced as in the US and capitalism still has a 'human face.'\" She noted that \"Americans still work nine full weeks (350 hours) longer than West Europeans do and paid vacation days across Western Europe are well above the US threshold.\" Researchers at Oxford Economics hired by the US Travel Association estimated that in 2014 \"about 169m [vacation] days, equivalent to $52.4bn in lost benefits\", went unused by American workers. Professor Gary L. Cooper argued Americans \"have a great deal to learn from Europeans about getting better balance between work and life\" and wrote: The notion that working long hours and not taking holidays makes for a more productive workforce is, in my view, a managerial myth, with no foundation in organizational or psychological science. The human body is a biological machine, and like all machines can wear out. In addition, if employees don't invest personal disposal time in their relationships outside, with their family, loved ones and friends, they will be undermining the very social support systems they may need in difficult and stressful times. Driving habits Americans are seen to be over-reliant on personal automobiles. They are also seen to be easily confused by roundabouts. Consequences of American stereotypes Along with many stereotypes, nations view the United States as one of the most powerful nations in the world. However, this view is often coupled with the view that the United States is corrupt, arrogant, cold and/or bloodthirsty. Peter Glick, co-author of \"Anti-American Sentiment and America's Perceived Intent to Dominate: An 11-Nation Study\", conducted research on 5,000 college students from eleven countries using the stereotype content model (SCM) and the image theory (IT) measure. \"Consistent with the SCM and IT measure was the",

For example, one of the most infamous anti-American acts against the United States was the 9/11 attacks. American stereotypes were not the main proponent of these attacks, but stereotypes become self-fulfilling and normative. If America is seen as arrogant, power hungry, intrusive, etc., then it is perceived that most American individuals exhibit this behavior, at least to some degree, and that the nation as a whole involves itself in situations in which it may have no business interfering See also American imperialism Americanization Americentrism Anti-Americanism American studies American Idiot (song) Climate change in the United States Culture of the United States Global warming controversy in the United States Media bias in the United States Propaganda in the United States Stereotypes of groups within the United States British stereotypes References Further reading Pells, Richard.

It was inaugurated in 1965 by then President of India Dr. S. Radhakrishnan. The museum consists of a gallery with rare photographs of Mahatma Gandhi and letters written by him, a library and an auditorium. It serves as a venue for meetings organised on Gandhian values in Bengaluru. History The museum is said to be set up in the place where Gandhi used to take strolls. It was initially known as Gandhi Smaraka Nidhi under the chairmanship of Rajendra Prasad. In 1965, it was renamed as Gandhi Bhavan and was inaugurated by S. Radhakrishnan. At that time, the museum's land was in its possession in form of a lease. Later, Sri Ramakrishna Hegde, during his tenure as the Chief Minister of Karnataka donated the land to Gandhi Bhavan The main aim of Gandhi Bhavan was to propagate Gandhian philosophies and ideals among the people of the state, especially among the youth.

Stevenson was born in Derby. His involvement in cricket began when he was scorer for his father's team before he began playing alongside him at his cricket club. In 1968 he was playing for Derbyshire Old Juniors and made the Second XI in 1969. He played for the Derbyshire under 25s in 1972, while appearing for the Second XI. He was meanwhile employed by Rolls-Royce Limited in Derby. Stevenson played for Derbyshire in the Benson & Hedges Cup and John Player League in May 1974 and made his first-class debut in a match against the Indians in June 1974 in which he scored 25 not out and took 2 for 47. In May 1975 he played in a notable match against Lancashire at Buxton. It started in sweltering heat and Lancashire were able to run up 477 for 5 and take three wickets for 29 runs before the close of play. The next day Derbyshire defeated Glamorgan in the John Player League on the same ground. However on the Monday the ground was covered by 3 inches of snow and play was impossible. The Derbyshire team feared the worst on the Tuesday, for at that time bowlers' run-ups were protected but the wickets themselves were not and they were dismissed for 42 and 87. Stevenson took his first 5 wicket innings later that season with 5-65 against Essex. In 1976 he took 5-47 against both Somerset and Lancashire and in 1977 took 7-68 against Warwickshire in 1977. In 1978 after considered transferring in the previous season, Stevenson moved to Hampshire who offered him a longer-term contract than his native Derbyshire. Hampshire won the John Player League that summer defeating a Middlesex side containing nine current and future Test players at Bournemouth to take the title by 26 runs. In 1978 he took 6-73 against Sussex and 5-72 against Surrey. He achieved his best bowling performance of 7-22 against Oxford University in 1979 after 5-30 against Glamorgan and before 5-106 against Lancashire and 5-40 against Kent. In 1980 he took 5-66 against Worcestershire and 5-86 against Lancashire. He took 5-32 against Nottinghamshire, 5-94 against Glamorgan and 5-49 against his former team Derbyshire in 1981.

History Portions of U.S. 63 in northern Arkansas have their origins in the work of the Ozark Trails Association, which established a network of roads in northern Arkansas and southern Missouri beginning in the 1910s. A portion of roadway was mapped out in Arkansas between Mammoth Spring and Memphis, Tennessee, and built c. 1918-22. This roadway was eventually designated Highway A-7, and was later designated U.S. 63. Some of the original infrastructure of this early construction has survived the 1927 Mississippi flood and the realignment of U.S. 63 in 1967. Northwest of Tyronza, Old U.S. 63 runs for about 1-1/4 miles of original concrete pavement; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Four bridges built in the 1920s (three before the 1927 flood and one after, are also on the National Register; three southeast of Marked Tree, and one southeast of Tyronza. In April 2019, ArDOT submitted an application to AASHTO to reroute US 63 concurrent with US 49 between Brinkley and Jonesboro, eliminating the concurrencies with I-55 and I-555, and part of the concurrency with I-40.

The film is a memorial for Lam Ching-ying's passing away 20 years ago. Plot Prologue In the year 1840 in Oxtail Village-Hong Kong, a 20-year-old girl named Yik Siu-ha (aka Summer) was buried alive as an offering to her dead landlord into the afterlife. Both her and the landlord's bodies were placed in a casket and buried. Yik Siu-ha would spend her final mortal moments scratching her casket to escape. Unfortunately, both died from deep negative emotions and caused both to become jiangshi. Since ancient times, there have existed the jiangshi (a type of zombie that returns from the dead and feeds on the life force of living beings). Modernly, they are viewed as hopping vampires that prey on the blood of its victims. Although the government knew the existence of the jiangshi, they have buried all public knowledge about them and society viewed the threat as a myth. Originally, they dispatched Maoshan Taoist priests to handle the problem. Eventually though, the British Hong Kong government covertly created the Vampire Cleanup Department (aka VCD) to discreetly exorcise the jiangshi. Disguised as the city's sanitation, the VCD are the first line defense against vampire threats. About 20 years ago, Yat Lung Cheung and his wife (both part of VCD) fought against the jiangshi and lost. Both of them were bitten and infected, but Yat Lung's wife at the time was pregnant. Cheung was turning and he volunteered to cremate himself before he turns. Before his wife's death, his team members helped him deliver a baby boy. The boy would grown up to be Tim Cheung. Main Story Tim Cheung (Babyjohn Choi) is just an ordinary student in Hong Kong and looks after his paternal grandmother (who suffers from memory issues). Growing up, his classmates calls him 'rubbish bin' because his deceased parents worked in sanitation and his grandmother recycles cardboard for a living.

Chung offered to explain everything the following day, leaving Tim curious and confused. The following day, Tim made it to the sanitation building. Through a hidden door, Tim entered to meet Chung and was given a quick summary about HK's sanctioned anti-vampire operation. Chung wanted to recruit Tim into the VCD because of their aging members. However, everyone else was either against or reluctant to accept Tim due to their history with Yat Lung. Tim didn't believe in vampires and just wanted to leave. However, he quickly became a believer when he tripped over a detained vampire. Chung would reveal that Tim's parents were part of VCD and Yat Lung (Tim's father) was their leader. Chung explained his mother was bitten during her pregnancy and helped him develop an immunity towards vampire toxins, making him a great candidate to succeed their agency. Chung offered Tim a cup of \"Calming Tea\" (memory erasure tea) and ask him to think about things over. If Tim doesn't want to join, he can drink the tea and forget everything that ever happened or train to become a VCD agent. Tim chose to join the VCD. Tim soon started his anti-vampire training. Each of the agents taught Tim an area of expertise. Priest Ginger (Cheung-Yan Yuen) taught him anti-vampire amulet spells, Chau taught him martial arts, and Kui (Meng Lo) taught him how to use their anti-vampire weapons. While not ready to take on a vampire, Chau decided to take Tim to Sai Kung on his first training mission. A treasure hunter had dived into the lake (that was once Oxtail Village) and found two caskets. He opened one and died from wrath of the undead landlord (aka Vampire King). At the lake, Chung and Chau encountered the Vampire King and fought him. The fight was short as Tim encountered his own vampire and cried for help. Tim encountered Summer (Lin Min-chen). He fell into the lake where Summer bit Tim in the lip. As Summer drank Tim's unique blood, it transformed her rotten body into her former youthful form. Chau arrested Summer and took the body back to VCD HQ. Along the way, the VCD crew encountered Inspector Chu. Chu is part of the HK police division that co-manage the vampire situation with the VCD. However, he doesn't like the VCD and have his own research team look into new ways in dealing with the vampire situation. Chu is interested in developing an anti-vampire vaccine that would cure vampirism and end the VCD's jurisdiction. Chu's break would come when they discovered Summer's vampire tooth. At VCD HQ, the crew learned about Oxtail Village and Summer's unfortunate life.

Summer calmed down when she was exposed to watching Chinese Opera on TV and Tim took the time to study more about vampires. It was through one of the manuals that Tim learned the landlord is a Dry Vampire (a powerful and malevolent type) and Summer a Human Vampire (a vampire with human traits). Viewing Summer as harmless, Tim decided to keep her around to learn more about vampires. In between training, Tim learned that Summer loves Pig Blood Curd and enjoys Chinese Opera. As time went on, Summer continues to develop more human traits and the two began to show feelings for each other. Due to the dangerous nature of the job, Chau told Tim to fulfill any wish to his grandma to make her die feeling happy. Tim decided to bring Summer to his grandma's place to pretend they are a couple. Grandma Cheung was very happy to know Tim has a girlfriend. Because Summer can't be seen hopping around, Tim gave her a hover board to cover her vampire traits. While observing a couple walking and holding hands, Summer expressed the desire to walk for Tim and the two got even closer. Things would end when the Vampire King returned. Chau merely injured the Vampire King with amulet stakes. The vampire fed on the blood of rats to regain enough power to attack civilians. During that time, Tim was being tested for his ability to defeat a live vampire to prove he's ready to be a full-fledged VCD agent. However, after holding down the vampire, Tim wanted to show everyone that vampires don't necessarily need to be slayed. Distracted, Tim lost the upper-hand and the vampire was choking him to death. Chau wanted Tim to slay the vampire, but Tim couldn't. Summer's enhanced hearing detected Tim was in danger and charged into their sanctum to save Tim. Chau was angered to know he kept Summer and even defended her. Their argument was put on hold when they got the call about the Vampire King. Summer was neutralized and Tim begged Priest Ginger to not kill her and he agreed. Tim tried to reason with Chau about Summer, but he was too enraged and destroyed Tim's sword, saying he was unworthy to wield it. Things would take a turn for the worst when Inspector Chu returned to take over VCD. While Chau and Kui looked for the Vampire King, Chu arrived with official papers to replace the VCD with his own squad and armed with the experimental anti-vampire vaccine.

Despite their best efforts, the vampire proved to be powerful and Chau was bitten. The VCD team managed to hold the Vampire King with rope and drag his body up against the sunlight to burn him away. However, Tim was also stuck with the vampire as well. Summer broke free of her bindings and saved Tim from harm and helped burn the Vampire King to death. Sadly, Summer's actions cost her life.

He was advised instead to live the life of a crypto-Jew. He suffered martyrdom by being burned at the stake in Geneva on April 20, 1632. Early life Nicolas Antoine was born of Catholic parents in 1602 or 1603 at Briey, a small town of Lorraine. For five years he attended the college at Luxemburg, and was then sent to Pont-à-Mousson, Treves, and Cologne for higher instruction under the Jesuits. Their influence, however, seems to have been nil; for when Antoine returned to Briey, at the age of twenty, he was no longer an ardent Catholic. The doctrines of Protestantism attracted him, and he allowed himself to be converted by the fervent eloquence of Ferri, a preacher of reputation, and pastor of the Reformed Church in Metz. The young convert then attended the academies of Sedan and Geneva in order to study the Reformed faith, but the deeper he delved into the study of Protestantism the less fervent became his enthusiasm; and he",

Crypto-Judaism The rabbinate of Metz refused to receive the young man into Judaism, offering as an excuse the fear of reprisals on the part of the authorities, and Antoine was advised to go to the Netherlands or to Italy, where Jews enjoyed more liberty. Accompanied by a Christian clergyman whom he had known in Sedan, and whom he attempted to convert to Judaism on the way, he traveled to Venice. There he found that the prevailing conditions had been too favorably depicted. The Jews were tolerated by the Venetian Republic merely for commercial reasons; they lived in the Venetian Ghetto and were obliged to wear a yellow disk. The Venetian Jews could offer Antoine no more encouragement than their brethren of Metz. At Padua he met with a similar check. According to the documents produced at his trial, the Italian Jews gave him the \"diabolical advice\" to pursue the life of a pious Jew under the cloak of the Church. Antoine proceeded to Geneva, where he accepted a position as tutor in the family of the pastor and professor Diodati. For some time he also taught the upper class of the college, but, being an apostate from Catholicism, he was not considered sufficiently orthodox to be entrusted with the chair of philosophy at the Academy of Geneva. Protestant pastor Antoine, desiring to marry, sought another appointment. A new Protestant parish had just been formed at Divonne, a little village of the district of Gex, which had belonged to France since 1602, but was now under the religious jurisdiction of Geneva; and there Antoine obtained the position of pastor. Once installed, he sought to pacify his conscience. Revealing his inmost convictions to no one, he secretly observed a thoroughly Jewish mode of life, saying his prayers in Hebrew and observing all the Mosaic rites. In his public services he pronounced the name of Jesus as seldom as possible. He was never known to read the apostolic confession audibly. In the communion service, instead of the words \"This is my body, this is my blood\" he was once heard to say \"Your Savior remembers you\". His sermons, the texts for which were taken exclusively from Isaiah and the other prophets, became celebrated far and wide; yet they lacked any peculiarly Christian characteristics. The peasants of Divonne were perfectly satisfied with their pastor, who was eloquent in the extreme and full of kindness toward them; they were not shocked by the vague form of his sermons, but the lord of the adjoining manor was outraged. One Sunday, Antoine preached on the second Psalm, which, according to orthodox Christian theology, announces the coming of the son of God. Antoine, on the contrary, declared that God had no son and that there was but the one God. This was too much for the lord, he remonstrated loudly with the heretical pastor and threatened to denounce him to the synod. Antoine fell into gloomy despair; a nervous attack deprived him of",

To several colleagues from Geneva who had come to see him he began to chant the seventy-fourth Psalm, then he suddenly stopped, and, exclaiming that he was a Jew, blasphemed Christianity. He was put to bed but he escaped his watchers, passed the night wandering through the country, and was found the next morning in Geneva in a most pitiable condition, kneeling in the streets and calling loudly upon the God of Israel. He was placed in an asylum for the insane on Feb. 11, 1632. Medical treatment accomplished but little for him. His clerical colleagues did all they could to induce him to change his religion but he never ceased to proclaim that he was a Jew and desired to remain a Jew. Imprisonment and execution A charge of heresy could no longer be avoided; the chief of the Geneva police arrested Antoine, and instituted proceedings. While he was in prison the clergy were tireless in seeking his reconversion, trying in vain to make him sign a declaration of orthodox faith. Bidden to formulate his religious belief, he drew up twelve articles, which were submitted to an ecclesiastical court. In them he gave the tenets of Judaism in the style of Maimonides' Thirteen Principles of Faith, and added \"eleven philosophical objections against the dogma of the Trinity.\" At the same time he addressed to the judges three memorials, two of which have been preserved. In spite of the exertions of Metrezat, a pastor of Paris, and others, the judges were immovable. The trial commenced April 11; Antoine's attitude, full of dignity, aroused much sympathy. The threats of the judges were of no more avail than the persuasions of his colleagues. He repeated constantly: \"I am a Jew; and all I ask of God's grace is to die for Judaism.\" The court sought to show that he had promulgated his heretical doctrines at Geneva: this he contradicted most forcibly. All the efforts of the judges were met with the unchanging reply, \"With the help of God I am determined to die in my present belief.\" Fifteen clergymen or professors of theology were summoned as witnesses. Several of them begged for a light sentence, since, in their opinion, Antoine had committed no sin by becoming a Jew, although for his hypocrisy he deserved unfrocking or banishment, or, at worst, excommunication. Furthermore, they said that the matter ought not to be hastened, and that the advice of the various churches and academies should be sought. A fanatical majority, however, insisted that the judges should seize the present opportunity to demonstrate their faith, since it was most dangerous to absolve one who had professed Judaism while wearing the garb of a Christian priest. For some days longer the judges waited for Antoine to recant. As his recantation was not forthcoming, they pronounced sentence April 20, 1632; condemning him to be loaded with chains, placed upon a pyre, to be there strangled, and then burned. In vain the clergy petitioned for a respite; Antoine was executed the same day. References Bernard Lescaze, La confession",

Career Notable academic contribution Document Raj Raman’s PhD thesis was later published as her first book titled Document Raj: Writing and Scribes in Early Colonial South India (2012), a work on company rule in South Asia. Raman’s granular research on colonial bureaucratic writing practices renders the book a near-ethnography of the time, as the 18th century colonial cutcherry comes to life. Her method calls for close attention to media and practices of infrastructure, charting a new path in South Asian historiography. Document Raj demonstrates how regimes of legal and bureaucratic document production, writing practices and their effects on language pedagogy enabled new forms of power in colonial India. Document Raj studies the political, linguistic, and pedagogic connotations of written accountability by attending to its colonial career. According to Dipesh Chakrabarty, “Document Raj breaks new ground in South Asian history. Raman’s imaginative investigations into the workings of the East India Company’s district offices in colonial Madras provide a powerful analysis of the critical role that scribal cultures played in enabling the Raj to operate as a vast writing machine. Original in its approach, this book will reinvigorate debates about the nature and consequences of colonial rule in the subcontinent.” Her works are highly relevant in Tamil historiography. She has also edited two volumes With Prof. Daniel T. Rodgers and Prof. Helmut Reimitz, Cultures in Motion (2014) and with Dr Aparna Balachandran and Dr Rashmi Pant, Iterations of Law: Legal Histories from India (2018). The latter volume draws on Robert Cover’s claim to broaden the idea of law and legal meaning to include the normative universe that is built on custom, ethical and interpretative commitments. It urges historians to look for “the myriad appropriations of law to construct meaning” so that a “web of understanding that contests or aligns with the letter and spirit of the law” can be arrived at. She has also published more than a dozen of journal articles and public writings. She is also the Digital Humanities Faculty Fellow 2022–2023, at the Jackman Humanities Institute, University of Toronto, where Raman is engaged in a research project on Chennai’s water archives.

Life Provenance and early years Johann Jakob Breitinger was born to Protestant parents in Dinhard, a village north of Winterthur in the Canton of Zürich. He was orphaned at an early age, attending school in Horgen and Zürich. In 1830 he embarked on an apprenticeship with the then newly established construction business of Locher & Cie in Zürich. Between 1832 and 1837 he travelled and worked successively in Neuchâtel, Paris and Berlin, though it is unclear whether this period involved any formal further study. There was no appropriate education establishment in Neuchâtel, although in Berlin the Bauakademie (building academy) was taking students by the mid-1830s. It is, in any case, evident from Breitinger's later work that he was strongly influenced by several leading Berlin architects of the time including Friedrich August Stüler. Heinrich Strack, Eduard Knoblauch and, particularly, Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Career Back in Zurich, Breitinger headed up his own construction business between 1837 and 1845.",

This timber construction in what became the \"typical Swiss\" style was an ambitiously conceived hotel and an early indication of the boom in Alpine tourism that would take off later in the century. (The building itself was torn down and replaced with a more bombastic structure in 1872.) In 1845 he relocated to the Tyrol where he based himself for the next eight years. He set up and ran a mining operation and an associated asphalt factory near Innsbruck. On his return to Switzerland he worked as architect and project manager for new railway stations along a number of new railway lines. Railway construction displayed accelerating momentum in response to the 1852 Railway Law. Breitinger's first major railway-related contract came in 1853 and was with the newly founded Swiss Northeastern Railway, for which he built the station at Romanshorn which opened in 1855. Later in the decade he worked for the competing United Swiss Railways company, responsible for the construction of a series of stations along the lines from the northeast of Switzerland to Chur. Breitinger was also highly active in Zürich. He repeatedly submitted proposals for city development, for instance concerning a new development in round the main station (1855) and another for the Kratz quarter alongside the lake (1959). Between 1857 and 1867 he engaged more directly in the political aspects of Zürich's urban development, serving as a \"Gemeinderat\" (loosely, \"local councillor\") and as a member of the city's Buildings Commission. Along with Leonhard Zeugheer, Gustav Albert Wegmann and Ferdinand Stadler, Breitinger was part of a new generation of Zürich architects who learned their craft before a structured training programme in Architecture had been created in Switzerland. That deficiency would be remedied by the creation during the 1850s of the \"Polytechnikum Academy\", followed by the emergence from it of a subsequent generation of architecture students taught and mentored by the formidable Gottfried Semper. Between 1865 and 1867 Breitinger teamed up with these recently trained younger architects to put forward a major development plan for the city of Zürich. Unfortunately, many of Breitinger's Zürich buildings no longer exist. One that survived in the heart of the city, thanks to a referendum conducted in response to a contentious redevelopment plans in the 1960s, which has more recently been imaginatively and carefully restored, is the \"Great Minster Chapel\", built between 1858 and 1860, across the Zwingliplatz beyond the Theological Faculty in the former cloisters of the \"Great Minster\", in the \"Old town\". The chapel applies a Swiss vision the so-called English Tudor Gothic style, with a large fountain on the west side of the building. Breitinger achieved significant additional interior floor space by using a polygonal floor plan which pushes through, far into the adjacent pre-existing \"helper building\". Fountain and chapel are both part of a more ambitious (otherwise unrealised) plan that Breitinger had drawn up in 1858 for a renovation of the Medieval \"Helferei Quarter\".

It is regarded by many Catholics as a continuation or actualization of St. Augustine of Hippo’s the City of God (De Civitate Dei). It proposes, much like the City of God, a metaphysical appreciation of universal history as an actual war between God and the Devil.

Key points The Catholic Encyclopedia depicts the key point of Speech of Universal History as follows: “…This is why the idea of Providence is at the same time the law of history. If the crash of empires \"falling one upon another\" does not in truth express some purpose of God regarding humanity, then history, or what is called by that name, is indeed no longer anything but a chaotic chronology, the meaning of which we should strive in vain to disentangle. In that case, fortune, or rather chance, would be the mistress of human affairs; the existence of humanity would be only a bad dream, or phantasmagoria, whose changing face would be inadequate to mask a void of nothingness. We should be fretting ourselves in that void without reason and almost without cause, our very actions would be but phantoms, and the only result of so many efforts accumulated through so many thousands of years would be the conviction, every day more clear, of their uselessness, which would be another void of nothingness. And why, after all, were there Greeks and Romans? Of what use was Salamis? Actium? Poitiers? Lepanto? Why was there a Caesar, and a Charlemagne? Let us frankly own, then, that unless something Divine circulates in history, there is no history. Nations like individuals, live only by maintaining uninterrupted communication with God, and it is precisely this condition of their existence which is called by the name of Providence. Providence is the condition or the possibility of history, as the stability of the laws of nature is the condition of the possibility of science. ..It was Providence that made of the Jewish people a people apart, a unique people, the chosen people, charged with maintaining and defending the worship of the true God throughout the pagan centuries, against the prestige of an idolatry which essentially consisted in the deification of the energies of nature. It was Providence that, by means of Roman unity and of its extension throughout the known universe, rendered not only possible but easy and almost necessary, the conversion of the world to Christianity. It was Providence, again, that developed the features of the modern world out of the disorder of barbarous invasions and reconciled the two antiquities under the law of Christ If the action of Providence is manifest anywhere, it is in the sequence of the history of Christianity. And what is more natural under the circumstances than to make of its history the demonstration of its truth?\" References Works about history French literature Catholic theology and doctrineTabebuia ochracea, known as corteza amarillia in Spanish, is a timber tree native to South America, Cerrado and Pantanal vegetation in Brazil.

The charity cares for babies, children and young people with life-limiting conditions, and their families, across Surrey and West London. They provide specialist clinical and holistic care to families from diagnosis to end of life and throughout bereavement. Shooting Star Children's Hospices offers bespoke support free of charge to families. This includes a comprehensive range of therapies and support groups, specialist nursing care and respite, symptom management, end-of-life care, and bereavement support. They currently support around 700 families who have a baby, child, or young adult with a life-limiting condition, or who have been bereaved. They have two children's hospices: Christopher's, in Artington near Guildford, and Shooting Star House in Hampton, London. History Shooting Star Children's Hospices was formed in 2011 from the merger of two existing children's hospices. CHASE (Children's Hospices Association for the South-East) and The Shooting Star Trust combined to become Shooting Star Chase, which later became Shooting Star Children's Hospices in February 2019. CHASE was registered as a charity on 13 November 1994 after founder Julia Lever MBE was prompted by an article in a national newspaper describing the plight of a family living with their life-limited daughter. Julia soon realised there was no comparable service in South-East England. CHASE introduced its Community Care team on 10 May 1999 and Christopher's children's hospice was opened in November 2001. In 1995, Kate Turner MBE established The Shooting Star Trust with the aim of providing a home-from-home environment offering medical and practical services free of charge to families in South-West London. The charity was named Shooting Star Trust in recognition of children with life-limiting conditions, who, like shooting stars, shine bright but are gone far too soon. In 2005, Shooting Star House children’s hospice in Hampton opened. Within the first month, the hospice had been used by 26 children with life-limiting conditions.

For elections of officers to Aboriginal Land Councils under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW), or a Rural Lands Board under the Rural Lands Protection Act 1998 (NSW), the Land and Environment Court acts to consider disputed returns. History The Court's jurisdiction over disputed electoral returns can be traced to the practices of the United Kingdom Parliament. Until 1604, disputed returns were decided by the King in Chancery. From 1604 to 1868, the British House of Commons exercised the jurisdiction. The Grenville Act 1770 (UK) provided for the determination of disputes by a Select Committee of the House of Commons. Later, a committee of 11 members were chosen by ballot to report their decision to the House. In essence, the parliament had the jurisdiction to determine whether a person had been properly elected, rather than the Courts. In 1868, the Parliamentary Elections Act 1868 (UK) was passed conferring jurisdiction on two judges of the Queen's Bench. The transfer of jurisdiction from Parliament to the courts was hastened by a concern with the partisanship of Parliament in ruling on electoral disputes. At the time of Federation of Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania had transferred jurisdiction over disputed returns to their Supreme Courts. South Australia and Queensland had created hybrid tribunals. Victoria and New South Wales retained the exclusive jurisdiction to determine disputed returns for themselves. New South Wales gave the Supreme Court exclusive jurisdiction over disputed returns with the introduction of section 32 of the Parliamentary Electorates and Elections (Amendment) Act 1928. The High Court of Australia sits as the Australian Court of Disputed Returns for federal elections Prior to the enactment of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Act (No 1) 2001, which commenced on 16 July 2001, the High Court could refer federal electoral disputes to the Supreme Court of a state.

It was first published in Hora Cero Semanal between 1957 and 1959. Since its original release it has been hailed as a universal masterpiece of its genre, especially in South America. Oesterheld returned to El Eternauta with a remake published in 1969 (illustrated by Alberto Breccia and left unfinished), and a sequel, El Eternauta II, published in 1976 (working again with Solano López).

Since the restoration of democracy in the country in 1983, El Eternauta has been continued in a string of different sequels and versions by a variety of writers and artists, while the original work is now considered as the most important and influential historieta/comic of Argentina. Publication history The Eternauta was first published in Hora Cero Suplemento Semanal on September 4, 1957. Quickly becoming a success, the serial publication ran until 1959. It was reissued in 1961 in a dedicated magazine, Eternauta, published by Editorial Emilio Ramírez. In 1969, the comic's author Héctor Germán Oesterheld rewrote El Eternauta, with changes to the story, more political references and more violence. It became an open critique of dictatorial regimes and United States' imperialism. This version featured artwork by Alberto Breccia, who drew the story in an experimental and unique style diverging from the original expression. It was first published on May 29, 1969 in the weekly Gente. The following years the series was also published in several European magazines, such as Linus, El Globo, Alter Alter, Il Mago, Charlie Mensuel and Metal Hurlant. In December 1975, Ediciones Record began publishing new episodes of Eternauta II in Skorpio. Oesterheld resumed the story, with artwork once again by the original version's Francisco Solano López. Disturbed by the Dirty War and political repression of the period, Oesterheld criticized the dictatorship. He placed himself as a narrating character within the story. Having joined the banned leftist organization Montoneros with his daughters, Oesterheld wrote the chapters from hidden locations. He disappeared in 1977. Oesterheld is believed to have died after 1979, when he was last reported alive. His daughters also disappeared, as were their husbands. Only his widow and two grandsons survived, the youngest boy recovered from government custody after being born while his mother was in prison. Other authors have continued the saga. A third part, El Eternauta, Tercera Parte (1983), published after the restoration of democracy, met with moderate success. It was criticized for being just another sci-fi comic instead of a continuation of the series' political content. Later chapters, El mundo arrepentido and El Eternauta, El regreso, again feature artwork by Solano López. In 2015, Fantagraphics Books published the first translation of the work into English, under the title The Eternaut. It was translated by Erica Mena. The publication won the 2016 Eisner Award of the category, \"Best Archival Collection/Project—Strips\". Italian comics magazine L'Eternauta, started in 1982, took its title from the lead character. It initially featured Ongaro's 1983 work on the series. Italian pop-rock band Eternauti also took its name from this comic. By Oesterheld El Eternauta (1957) (script) and F.

Juan Salvo, along with a couple of friends (Favalli, Lucas and Polski who were playing truco at his house), his wife and daughter remain safe from the lethal snowflakes thanks to the protection of Juan Salvo's home and the cleverness of Favalli. They organize to survive the ordeal, making special suits to be able to leave the house to gather supplies. During these trips they find Pablo, a twelve-year-old boy, and realize that crazed or needy survivors may be as much of a threat as the deadly snow. A few days into the snowfall, they learn that the phenomenon was caused by an extraterrestrial invasion to Earth. They are recruited by the army to fight the invaders. During this time, Salvo meets and befriends a few of his fellow soldiers, namely Franco, a lathe operator, and Mosca, a journalist. As they march towards the country's capital city, they fight on different occasions against giant insects (Cascarudos, \"Beetles\"); a humanoid species with many more fingers than humans, especially on their right hands (Manos, \"Hands\"); giant armored elephantine beasts capable of knocking buildings down (Gurbos); and fellow men who were captured and altered (Hombres-robot, \"Robot-men\"). All of these beings are pawns, remotely controlled through implants or fear devices by the real invaders, los Ellos (\"Them\"), unseen creatures who remain hidden, controlling everything from the distance. After managing a few victories, their forces suffer defeats and get reduced to a few men. Juan Salvo decides to return to his wife and daughter to go into hiding with them. A passing nuclear missile convinces Favalli and Franco that a larger global war has begun and that they cannot return empty-handed. Salvo reluctantly agrees to join them. After the trio attacks the aliens' HQ in Buenos Aires, they flee just before the city is destroyed by a nuclear attack. Gradually, the aliens lure the pockets of survivors throughout the country to \"snow-free zones\" as part of an elaborate ruse. Salvo's group splits, and he tries to escape with his wife and daughter using one of the alien spaceships. He accidentally triggers a time travel apparatus in the craft. As a result, the three are lost in separate time dimensions known as \"continuums\". Juan Salvo begins to travel through time seeking them, eventually being named Eternauta, a voyager of eternity.

Critics have frequently likened the invaders and their methods as veiled references to the various military-led coups which occurred at the time in the country. The three versions written by Oesterheld (the first part, its remake and the second part) were contemporaneous with the de facto governments of Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, Juan Carlos Onganía and the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional, respectively. It has also been noted that, except for the \"Ellos\", none of the invaders is truly evil; they are noble beings forced to carry out the orders of others. Critics believe Oesterheld was conceptually attacking the Dirty War or writing an allegory of class struggle. Adaptation Directors such as Adolfo Aristarain, Fernando Solanas or Gustavo Mosquera expressed interest in a film adaptation, but could not manage reasonable production costs. In 2008, under supervision by Elsa Oesterheld, the writer's widow, an Italian production company worked on a film adaptation of the original comic. The story would be set in Buenos Aires and the possibility of co-producing the film with INCAA was discussed. Lucrecia Martel was reported as slated to direct the film and said that production was already past the \"embryonic stages.\" In 2009, however, Martel was dropped due to conceptual differences with the producers. On September 4, 2017, on the 60th anniversary of the comic's release, a group of independent artists from Argentina presented an animated short film called “60 seconds of darkness”, an adaptation of a small fragment of the original comic. In February 2020, it was announced that The Eternaut would be adapted into a TV series for Netflix The series will be directed by Bruno Stagnaro and will be contextualized in the present.

The book focuses on the events in the life of an American man living in Paris and his feelings and frustrations with his relationships with other men in his life, particularly an Italian bartender named Giovanni whom he meets at a Parisian gay bar. Giovanni's Room is noteworthy for bringing complex representations of homosexuality and bisexuality to a reading public with empathy and artistry, thereby fostering a broader public discourse of issues regarding same-sex desire. Plot David, a young American man whose girlfriend has gone off to Spain to contemplate marriage, is left alone in Paris and begins an affair with an Italian man, Giovanni. The entire story is narrated by David during \"the night which is leading me to the most terrible morning of my life,\" when Giovanni will be executed. Baldwin tackles social isolation, gender and sexual identity crisis, as well as conflicts of masculinity within this story of a young bisexual man navigating the public sphere in a society that rejects a core aspect of his sexuality. Part one David, in the South of France, is about to board a train back to Paris. His girlfriend Hella, to whom he had proposed before she went to Spain, has returned to the United States. As for Giovanni, he is about to be guillotined. David remembers his first experience with a boy, Joey, who lived in Brooklyn. The two bonded and eventually had a sexual encounter during a sleepover. The two boys began kissing and having sex. The next day, David left, and a little later he took to bullying Joey in order to feel like a real man. David now lives with his father, who is prone to drinking, and his aunt, Ellen. The latter upbraids the father for not being a good example to his son. David's father says that all he wants is for David to become a real man. Later, David begins drinking, too, and drinks and drives once, ending up in an accident. Back home, the two men talk, and David convinces his father to let him skip college and get a job instead. He then decides to move to France to find himself. After a year in Paris, penniless, he calls Jacques, an older homosexual acquaintance, to meet him for supper so he can ask for money.

Giovanni recounts how he met Guillaume in a cinema; how the two men had dinner together because Giovanni wanted a free meal. He also explains that Guillaume is prone to making trouble. Later, the two men go back to Giovanni's room and they have sex. Flashing forward again to the day of Giovanni's execution, David is in his house in the South of France. The caretaker comes round for the inventory, as he is moving out the next day. She encourages him to get married, have children, and pray. Part two David moves into Giovanni's small room. They broach the subject of Hella, about whom Giovanni is not worried, but who reveals the Italian's misogynistic prejudices about women and the need for men to dominate them. David then briefly describes Giovanni's room, which is always in the dark because there are no curtains and they need their own privacy. He goes on to read a letter from his father, asking him to go back to America, but he does not want to do that. The young man walks into a sailor; David believes the sailor is a gay man, though it is unclear whether this is true or the sailor is just staring back at David. A subsequent letter from Hella announces that she is returning in a few days, and David realizes he has to part with Giovanni soon. Setting off to prove to himself that he is not gay, David searches for a woman with whom he can have sex. He meets a slight acquaintance, Sue, in a bar and they go back to her place and have sex; he does not want to see her again and has only just had her to feel better about himself. When he returns to the room, David finds a hysterical Giovanni, who has been fired from Guillaume's bar. Hella eventually comes back and David leaves Giovanni's room with no notice for three days.

He imagines that after Giovanni has compromised himself, Guillaume makes excuses for why he cannot rehire him as a bartender; in reality, they both know that Giovanni is no longer of interest to Guillaume's bar's clientele since so much of his life has been played out in public.

The Fairy, whom David had a relationship with in the army, and who was later discharged for being gay. Major themes Social alienation One theme of Giovanni's Room is social alienation. Susan Stryker notes that prior to writing Giovanni's Room, James Baldwin had recently emigrated to Europe and \"felt that the effects of racism in the United States would never allow him to be seen simply as a writer, and he feared that being tagged as gay would mean he couldn't be a writer at all.\" In Giovanni's Room, David is faced with the same type of decision; on the surface he faces a choice between his American fiancée (and value set) and his European boyfriend, but ultimately, like Baldwin, he must grapple with \"being alienated by the culture that produced him.\" Identity In keeping with the theme of social alienation, this novel also explores the topics of origin and identity. As Valerie Rohy of the University of Vermont argues, \"Questions of origin and identity are central to James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room, a text which not only participates in the tradition of the American expatriate novel exemplified by Stein and, especially, by Henry James but which does so in relation to the African-American idiom of passing and the genre of the passing novel. As such, Giovanni's Room poses questions of nationalism, nostalgia, and the constitution of racial and sexual subjects in terms that are especially resonant for contemporary identity politics. Masculinity David grapples with insecurities pertaining to his masculinity throughout the novel. He spends much of his time comparing himself to every man he meets, ensuring that his performative masculinity allows him to \"pass\" while negotiating the public sphere. For David, masculinity is intertwined with sexual identity, and thus he believes that his same-sex desires act against his masculinity. Baldwin seems to direct the source of his toxic masculinity towards David's father, as he takes on many of his father's problematic traits. David craves an authority figure and blames his father's lack of authority and responsibility for many of his struggles throughout the novel. This comes to a head when David drunk-drives (a habit he assigns to his father) and is involved in an accident. When his father arrives all he can say is: \"I haven't done anything wrong have I?\". This ends his relationship with his father and cements his toxic masculine behaviours. Manhood The phrase 'manhood'",

        "prompt": "throughout the book, in much the same ways that we find masculinity manifesting itself. The difference between the two themes, in this case, is that David's manhood seems to be more to do with his sexual relationships, whereas his masculinity is guided by learned public behaviours he claims to inherit from his father. The self-loathing and projecting that ensues seem to depict the final blow to a man who already had a great amount of dysphoria. Baldwin's positioning of manhood within the narrative aligns it also with nationhood, sexuality and all facets of performance within the public sphere. Josep Armengol linked Baldwin's description of manhood as a way of him navigating his experiences of blackness in the LGBTQ+ community, particularly when David describes his earliest same-sex encounter with a boy called Joey. In this description \"black\" becomes a motif for experience and his dark thoughts surrounding Joey and his body. LGBTQ+ spaces and movement in the public sphere Much of the integral plot of Giovanni's Room occurs within queer spaces, with the gay bar David frequents being the catalyst that not only drives the plot, but allows it to occur. The bar acts as a mediator for David, Baldwin uses this setting to bring up much of the conflict of the novel, however, it remains a place that David returns to. Baldwin's novel is one of the most accurate portrayals of LGBTQ+ people navigating the public and private spheres of its time. It negotiates the behaviour of publicly LGBTQ+ people alongside those who are still \"closeted\", like David, and how these differing perspectives have an effect on the individual as well as the community that they navigate. Homosexuality/Bisexuality Sexuality is the singular, major theme of Baldwin's novel. However, he layers this reading of sexuality by making David's internal conflict not only between homosexuality and heteronormativity but also, between homosexuality and bisexuality. This layered experience reinforces the notion that David's experience of sexuality is tied to his experience of gender norms. He struggles with the idea that he can be attracted to people of either gender because he sees it as proof of his fragile masculinity. In creating this manifestation, Baldwin fairly accurately describes the male bisexual experience of the time, the feeling of indecisiveness and insecurity. It is this portrayal of bisexuality and the experience of bi-erasure that makes Baldwin's novel particularly unique. Question of bisexuality Ian Young argues that the novel portrays homosexual and bisexual life in western society as uncomfortable and uncertain, respectively. Young also points out that despite the novel's \"tenderness and positive qualities\" it still ends with a murder. Recent scholarship has focused on the more precise designation of bisexuality within the novel. Several scholars have claimed that the characters can be more accurately seen as bisexual, namely David and Giovanni. As Maiken Solli claims, though most people read the characters as gay/homosexual, \"... a bisexual perspective could be just as valuable and enlightening in understanding the book, as well as exposing the bisexual experience.\" Though the novel is considered a homosexual and bisexual novel, Baldwin has",

The novel's protagonist, David, seems incapable of deciding between Hella and Giovanni and expresses both hatred and love for the two, though he often questions if his feelings are authentic or superficial. Inspiration An argument can be made that David resembles Baldwin in Paris as he left America after growing up under its racism. David, though not a victim of racism like Baldwin himself, is an American who escapes to Paris. However, when asked if the book was autobiographical in an interview in 1980, Baldwin explains he was influenced by his observations in Paris, but the novel wasn't necessarily shaped by his own experiences: \"No, it is more of a study of how it might have been or how I feel it might have been. I mean, for example, some of the people I have met. We all met in a bar, there was a blond French guy sitting at a table, he bought us drinks. And, two or three days later, I saw his face in the headlines of a Paris paper. He had been arrested and was later guillotined. That stuck in my mind.\" Literary significance and criticism Even though Baldwin states that \"the sexual question and the racial question have always been entwined\", in Giovanni's Room, all of the characters are white. This was a surprise for his readers, since Baldwin was primarily known for his novel Go Tell It on the Mountain, which puts emphasis on the African-American experience. Highlighting the impossibility of tackling two major issues at once in America, Baldwin stated:I certainly could not possibly have—not at that point in my life—handled the other great weight, the 'Negro problem.' The sexual-moral light was a hard thing to deal with. I could not handle both propositions in the same book. There was no room for it.Nathan A. Scott Jr., for example, stated that Go Tell It on the Mountain showed Baldwin's \"passionate identification\" with his people whereas Giovanni's Room could be considered \"as a deflection, as a kind of detour.\" Baldwin's identity as a gay and black man was questioned by both black and white people. His masculinity was called into question, due to his apparent homosexual desire for white men – this caused him to be labelled as similar to a white woman. He was considered to be \"not black enough\" by his fellow race because of this, and labeled subversive by the Civil Rights Movement leaders. Baldwin's American publisher, Knopf, suggested that he \"burn\" the book because the theme of homosexuality would alienate him from his readership among black people. He was told, \"You cannot afford to alienate that audience. This new book will ruin your career, because you're not writing about the same things and in the same manner as you were before, and we won't publish this book as a favor to you.\" However, upon publication critics tended not to be so harsh thanks to Baldwin's standing",

The Ahmadi teaching that Jesus survived crucifixion, traveled east in order to preach to the Lost Tribes of Israel and died naturally, as promoted by Ghulam Ahmad, continues to be a source of friction with Christianity, in which vicarious atonement and the resurrection of Jesus are central tenets. The historian Francis Robinson states: Ahmadiyya teachings also identify the emergence of the Antichrist (Al-Masih ad-Dajjal) as foretold in Islamic eschatology with the missionary expansion and colonial dominance of European Christianity. Ghulam Ahmad, who wrote extensively on this topic, identified the Antichrist principally with colonial missionaries who, according to him, were to be countered through argumentation rather than by physical warfare. While the term Dajjāl is taken as a reference to the forces of falsehood in matters of ideology and religious belief, prophecies concerning Gog and Magog (or Yaʾjūj Maʾjūj) are taken as relating to the duplicity in the realm of politics and the shattering of world peace by the same forces – whose ancestors are thought to be the Slavic and Teutonic peoples – and are seen as embodied by the political (as opposed to religious) dominance of European powers. The conflict between Russia and the United States as two superpowers, or the militant rivalry between the communist and capitalist systems and their impact over the nations of the world, are thus seen as having occurred in accordance with prophecies concerning Gog and Magog. These views, too, have proven controversial with some Christians. Sikhism Ahmadis have recognised Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, as a holy man since Ghulām Ahmad carried out a detailed study of him and the history of Sikhism. Ahmadis believe that historically, Sikhism was a Sufi sect of Islam, a view strongly opposed by modern Sikhs. Hinduism Ghulām Ahmad was involved in debates with leaders of the Arya Samaj movement of Hinduism and wrote several texts on the subject. Ahmadis, like other Muslims, believe that the last, perfect message from God was brought to Muhammad. However, unlike mainstream Muslims, Ahmadis believe that many founders or significant figures of various faiths, including Krishna and Buddha, have brought messages from God. Ghulām Ahmad claimed to be the Kalki Avatar, the last avatar of Vishnu, whom Hindus were waiting for. However, he did not agree with the Hindu concept of incarnations of God. He considered Krishna and Rama human prophets who preached to others about the One God, and he believed that Hindus had distorted this view into polytheism over many thousands of years. Judaism Ahmadiyya Muslims are on good terms with the Jews, unlike most other Islam branches. Ahmadis believe that the creation of the State of Israel accords with Biblical prophecies. Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement The Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement does not see Ghulām Ahmad as a prophet. Ahmadis claim this is a result of misinterpreting his statements on his coming \"in the spirit of Muhammad\" (similar to John the Baptist coming in the spirit and power of Elijah). Ahmadi Muslims believe Ghulām Ahmad to be the Mahdi, Islam's prophesied messianic figure. Mainstream Muslims, however, say that he did not",

Because the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement’s view of Ghulām Ahmad is closer to current mainstream Islamic thought than the view held by Ahmadis, its literature has found greater acceptance among the Muslim intelligentsia, </ref> The government of Pakistan views members of both Ahmadi movements as non-Muslims, and this is recorded on their travel documents. But Ahmadi citizens from Western countries and some Muslim nations perform the Hajj and Umrah, as the Saudi government is not made aware that they are Ahmadis when they apply for a visa. A 1970 court decision in India upheld the right of Ahmadis to identify themselves as Muslims. The term Qadiani which is used to refer to Ahmadiyyas is pejorative to both Ahmadi sects the original Ahmadiyya and the Lahori Ahmadiyyas. In the past, there has been widespread persecution of Ahmadis by other Muslims in India and Pakistan. Sporadic violence, as well as subtler persecution, continues today. Fulfillment of prophecy Ahmadis believe that the founders of all the major world religions were working towards the establishment of Islam in its broadest sense, as part of the divine scheme of the development of religion. They say that the completion and consummation of this development occurred with the coming of Muhammad, and that the \"manifestation\" of Muhammad’s prophethood and message was destined to be perfected with the coming of the Mahdi. Because they regard Ghulām Ahmad as the Mahdi, they believe he is the \"Promised One\" of all religions, fulfilling eschatological prophecies found in the scriptures of the Abrahamic religions, Zoroastrianism, Indian religions, Native American traditions and others. Christianity Ahmadis believe that many verses of the Old Testament and New Testament—such as those in the Book of Revelation, and those about the Second Coming of Christ in the 24th chapter of Matthew—were prophecies regarding the Messiah of the end times, and that they were fulfilled through the appearance of Ghulām Ahmad. Ahmadis also cite a passage in Chapter 12 of the Book of Daniel: \"The time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away\" is interpreted by Ahmadis to mean the supersession of Judaic law by Islamic law, and \"the abomination that maketh desolate\" to mean the banning of idol worship brought about with the founding of Islam. Based on these interpretations and the day-year principle, Ahmadis believe that the \"thousand two hundred and ninety days\" are actually 1,290 years of the Islamic calendar, ending in 1875, when, according to Ahmadi belief, Ghulām Ahmad began to receive divine revelations with continuity. Ahmadis maintain that, as per Judeo-Christian prophecy regarding the coming of the Messiah and the Second Coming of Christ, Ghulām Ahmad appeared at the end of the 6,000th year from the time of Adam, and that with him, the final, 7th epoch of 1000 years began. It is also important to note that Ahmadis don't believe that the world is 6000 years old, but only the approximate time since the first prophet being 6000 years.",

They believe that the Messiah, Isa (i.e., Jesus), and the Mahdi whose comings are prophesied in Islam are, in fact, two titles or roles for the same person. According to Ahmadi thought, the promised redeemer is called \"Isa\" or \"Masih\" (Messiah) in relation to his task of refuting what they perceive as the erroneous doctrines of Christianity, and \"Mahdi\" in relation to his task of reforming and guiding Muslims. His advent is seen as a continuation of the prophethood of Muhammad. Hinduism Ahmadis regard Krishna as a prophet of God, citing the hadith and Qur'an. Ghulām Ahmad stated that the terms \"avatar\" and \"prophet\" were synonymous, and that the Avatar was equivalent to the Qur'anic Messenger. Buddhism Members of the Ahmadiyya community believe that Ghulām Ahmad was the fulfillment of the prophecy of the Maitreya, a future Buddha said to usher in an age of peace and security. Ghulām Ahmad himself wrote in his book Jesus in India that the Maitreya was actually Jesus, and that Jesus travelled to India, Kashmir and Tibet (predominantly Buddhist regions at the time) to preach to Jews who had migrated there and converted to other religions. Ghulām Ahmad called himself the \"reflection of all prophets\", and regarded Gautama Buddha as a prophet. According to him, Jesus was both the Jewish Messiah and the Maitreya. Thus, Ghulām Ahmad claimed to have fulfilled the prophecy of the Second Coming of Jesus and, in turn, the prophecy of the Second Coming of the Maitreya as well. \"Reflection of All Prophets\" Ghulām Ahmad claimed that he had been bestowed with the attributes of all biblical and non-biblical prophets, in accordance with a verse of the Qur'an that says all prophets will converge into one person in the future. He said he had received a revelation in which God called him \"the Champion of Allah in the mantle of Prophets\". The biblical prophets include Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Ishmael, Moses, David, Solomon and Jesus. He also likened his role to that of Adam, as the initiator of a new age. In various writings, he stated that he and Adam were born twins on a Friday and that, just as Adam was born in the final hours of the sixth day of the week, he was born in the final years of the sixth millennium: As per the Qur'an and the Bible, a day in the estimation of God is a thousand years. Ahmadis also believe that Ghulām Ahmad was the Second Coming of Noah, citing the prophecy made by Jesus in Ghulām Ahmad further compared himself to the Qur'anic figure Dhul-Qarnayn, who is often equated with Cyrus the Great.

It is loosely based on the British sitcom Robin's Nest, which was itself a spin-off of Man About the House, upon which Three's Company was based. Plot In Three's Company's final episodes, Vicky Bradford (Mary Cadorette) is introduced as a love interest of Jack Tripper (John Ritter), beginning with the episode titled \"Cupid Works Overtime.\" In the following two-part episode, \"Friends and Lovers\", Jack proposes marriage, but Vicky, afraid of marriage after witnessing her parents' tumultuous relationship and bitter divorce, declines the offer. Vicky instead convinces Jack to move in with her in the vacant apartment above his restaurant. Vicky's wealthy father James Bradford (Robert Mandan) buys the building from Jack's former boss, Frank Angelino. James does not approve of Jack and he constantly tries to disrupt his and Vicky's relationship. Other characters include E.Z.

The second spin-off was Robin's Nest, which ran from 1977 to 1981 and featured Richard O'Sullivan as Robin Tripp (the basis of the Jack Tripper character), who runs the titular restaurant along with his live-in girlfriend and her antagonistic father. Three's Company's producers were eager to capitalize on these spin-offs. In 1979, they had spun off The Ropers, based on George and Mildred, but the show ran for only one and a half seasons.

The series was planned as a spin-off from Three's Company and possibly a vehicle for Richard Kline, but ABC passed on the idea. As Three's Company entered its eighth season in September 1983, ratings took a dive in the face of stiff competition from the new NBC series The A-Team, and ABC approved the development of a new series to be called Three's a Crowd, starring Ritter. Development and casting of the new series occurred in secret as Three's Companys eighth season progressed. Ritter's cast members Richard Kline, Joyce DeWitt, Priscilla Barnes and Don Knotts were kept out of the loop. During a Christmas hiatus in late 1983, producers auditioned several female leads to play Jack's new love interest Vicky Bradford, and eventually decided upon Broadway actress Mary Cadorette. An embarrassing situation arose when DeWitt accidentally walked in on the auditions after visiting the studio to set up her dressing room at the end of the hiatus. Informed of the spin-off project and the looming cancellation of Three's Company, DeWitt was upset by the secrecy but soon reconciled with Ritter. She and Barnes found it difficult to tape the rest of the season, as both actresses learned that their characters would conclude with the series finale. Kline and Knotts were offered recurring roles on Three's a Crowd, but both declined the offer (Kline would make a guest appearance on the show in early 1985). Suzanne Somers reportedly lobbied to reprise her Three's Company character Chrissy Snow as Jack's love interest in the spin-off. Transition In transitioning from Three's Company to Three's a Crowd, series producers decided to follow the plot line of the British series. Season 8 of Three's Company drew to a close in a three-episode story arc. In the first of the three episodes, Janet meets wealthy art collector Phillip Dawson. In the second episode, she falls in love with him, while Jack meets and falls in love with stewardess Vicky Bradford. Her wealthy father, played by Robert Mandan, does not approve of the relationship. When first aired, the episode ended with the words \"To be continued... next fall\", and when rerun late in the summer, this was changed to \"To be continued... next week.\" The last episode of Three's Company aired as an hour-long special that kicked off the 1984–85 fall television season and set up the premise for Three's a Crowd. In the finale, Janet marries Phillip, Terri moves to Hawaii, while Jack and Vicky profess their love for one another, but Vicky, the child of a bitter divorce, turns down Jack's marriage proposal. They instead move in together in an apartment above Jack's bistro. In the last scene, Jack and Vicky are spending their first romantic evening together in the new apartment, only to have Mr. Bradford accidentally barge in on them, explaining that he has bought the building.

While the Jack Tripper character was the lead role in Three's Company, the show featured an ensemble cast of three with some other series regulars. However, the new show was centered around Jack. Vicky, her parents and E.Z. played supporting roles. The new show also employed more slapstick comedy for Ritter. The events and characters of the previous show were not mentioned, except in a late-season episode in which Larry Dallas appears. Ratings and cancellation Three's a Crowd garnered moderate ratings, having to compete with The A-Team on NBC. When the 1984–85 television season finished, the show placed 39th out of 77 shows with a 14.5/22 rating/share. This put the show on the fence with ABC, as it had enough of an audience to warrant renewal but its ratings paled in comparison to those of Three's Companys and The A-Team, which finished sixth for the season. The network would commit to only a half-season of 13 episodes to see how the series would place, and Ritter reportedly said that he would not return to the show unless a full season was ordered. Finally, ABC decided instead to pick up Diff'rent Strokes, which had just been canceled by NBC. Episodes Reruns Daytime reruns aired on ABC from September 23, 1985 to January 3, 1986, followed by another prime-time run on USA Network. Some syndicated versions aired under the title Three's Company, Too, using the theme song of Three's Company. Six episodes of the series were aired on TV Land in September 2006, and four episodes were aired on WGN America in October 2008. The series began airing on digital broadcast network Antenna TV in June 2011 (as Three's a Crowd with its \"Side by Side\" theme song).

During the whole series of this episodic journey, Mr. Zero is surprisingly oblivious to his deepest needs, wants, and desires. The story focuses on Mr. Zero, an accountant at a large, faceless company. After 25 years at his job, he discovers that he will be replaced by an adding machine. In anger and pain, he snaps and kills his boss. Mr. Zero is then tried for murder, found guilty, and hanged. He wakes up in a heaven-like setting known as the \"Elysian Fields.\" Mr. Zero meets a man named Shrdlu, then begins to operate an adding machine until Lieutenant Charles, the boss of the Elysian Fields, comes to tell Zero that he is a waste of space and his soul is going to be sent back to Earth to be reused. The play ends with Zero following a very attractive girl named Hope off-stage. Success The play was an influence on the Tennessee Williams play Stairs to the Roof. Years later, it was adapted into a 1969 film of the same name, written and directed by Jerome Epstein and starring Milo O'Shea, Phyllis Diller, Billie Whitelaw and Sydney Chaplin. In 1989, Chicago's Hystopolis Productions adapted Rice's play for puppets; the production was hailed for its visual design. In September 1992 this production went on to be featured at the First International Festival of Puppet Theater presented at The Public Theater in New York which was a co-production of Joseph Papp and the Jim Henson Foundation. The Adding Machine remains part of Hystopolis' professional repertoire. Musical adaptation In 2007, the play was adapted into a musical entitled Adding Machine with a score by Joshua Schmidt and a book by Jason Loewith and Schmidt. The musical debuted in Illinois at the Next Theatre Company in 2007. It then opened Off-Broadway at the Minetta Lane Theatre on February 25, 2008, after previews that started on February 8 In September 2016 the musical was produced at the Finborough Theatre in London England.

Pontardawe also has a primary school within it, or “Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Pontardawe (YGGP). It is often named by its students and staff “pointy”. With a population of 6,832 in 2011, it comprises the electoral wards of Pontardawe and Trebanos. A town council is elected. Pontardawe forms part of the county borough of Neath Port Talbot. On the opposite bank of the River Tawe, the village of Alltwen, part of the community of Cilybebyll, is administered separately from Pontardawe. Pontardawe is at the crossroads of the A474 road and the A4067 road. Pontardawe came into existence as a small settlement on the northwestern bank of the Tawe where the drovers' road from Neath and Llandeilo crossed the river to go up the valley to Brecon. The National Cycle Route 43 from Swansea to Builth Wells passes through the town and the recreation ground. First Cymru provides a bus service linking Pontardawe to Swansea, Neath, and Ystradgynlais. History The name, which translates to \"bridge on the Tawe\", first appears on a map in 1729, as \"Pont-ar-Dawye\" in Emanuel Bowen's New and Accurate Map of South Wales. By 1796, the Swansea Canal had connected Pontardawe with Swansea Docks. Accessibility by canal enabled the industrial development of the area, which started with the Ynysderw ironworks in 1835. Close to the ironworks, tinplate and steelworks became the basis of the town's development during the latter part of the 19th century, exporting products to all parts of the world. The industrialist William Parsons of Neath (1795-1864) developed the town's early industry, but from 1861 onwards, for the next 90 years, the Gilbertson family were the most important proprietors in the town, manufacturing iron, steel and tinplate. As well as metalwork, there was also significant coal mining in the area and a pottery at Ynysmeudwy. These industries declined during the 20th century. Small engineering firms, motor maintenance, building supplies, and a health centre, are on the Alloy Industrial Estate. The Church of St Peter, which has French-style architecture, was financed by William Parsons and completed in 1862. From 1861 until 1964, a railway line connected Pontardawe with the rest of the valley and further afield. The Swansea Vale Railway (SVR) was founded in 1845 to develop and extend the short tramroad which had been opened nearly 30 years earlier to transport the coal down the lower part of the valley to the Swansea docks. It was extended to Pontardawe and Ystalyfera in 1861, and to Brynamman in 1863. On 1 October 1873, the SVR opened a branch from Ynysygeinon, near Ystalyfera, to Coelbren on the Neath and Brecon Railway, thereby connecting Pontardawe for the first time to the national rail network. The Midland Railway took over operation of the SVR from 1 September 1874; and",

Traffic on the route began declining between the wars, and passenger services to Brecon were withdrawn in 1931 and those to Brynamman in 1950. The railway line through Pontardawe finally closed to all traffic in 1964. Landmarks The best-known landmark is the tall spire of St Peter's Church which dominates the centre of the town from its site on a high point of the valley floor close to the Swansea Canal. The town includes two sections of the Swansea Canal with a total length of . The old stone bridge of Pontardawe was built by William Edwards of Eglwsilan, a famous bridge builder. He also built the Old Bridge at Pontypridd, which was the longest single-span bridge in the world when it was constructed, as well as the bridge at Cenarth. Edwards was also responsible for the design of Morriston, a new town developed by the Swansea Valley industrialist Sir John Morris. Politics Prior to local government reorganisation in 1974, Pontardawe and district was served by Pontardawe Rural District Council; this merged in 1974 to become part of Lliw Valley DC and was subsequently reorganised again when the Pontardawe area became a part of Neath Port Talbot county borough. Pontardawe Town Council is currently controlled by Plaid Cymru. The constituency office of Jeremy Miles MS is in the town. As part of the South Wales West regional constituency, Pontardawe is also represented by Tom Giffard MS, Altaf Hussain MS, Sioned Williams MS, and Luke Fletcher MS. Music and arts The Pontardawe Arts Centre stages performances by musicians of both national and international fame. Every August from 1978, Pontardawe hosted the Pontardawe Festival; held on a weekend on the leisure centre playing-fields at Parc Ynysderw. This event featured singing, dancing, and other artistic performances from all over the world. Several years of bad weather affected admissions and due to the withdrawal of arts funding, the festival has ceased. Retail The first phase of a new retail park on Ffordd Parc Ynysderw, close to Cwmtawe Community School, opened in July 2008. In 2008, the Pontardawe Chamber for Trade & Commerce was formed.

The small 2-seat car had a length of and a width of . The Zoom was powered by a 45 kW (61.2 hp) electric motor. It was unique in having fold up rear wheels resulting in a shorter length when parked. Width remains constant at 1.52m, which means Zoom is higher in retracted wheelbase configuration. 2 scissor doors mounted on inclined axes reduce lateral bodywork clearance to a minimum and make Zoom easy to use in the tightest of spots. The Zoom was an urban and suburban concept car born of common research by Renault and Matra into modern electric cars. The Zoom was a relatively early venture into the world of city runabouts and utilised an electric power system in addition to a variable wheelbase. The engine is 90 percent recyclable. A communication centre mounted between the two seats houses a hands-free telephone and power-up control for Carminat navigation system. The concept for a variable wheelbase city car was revisited by the MIT CityCar and applied in the development of the Hiriko folding two-seat urban electric car It did not go into production due to it being a concept but also not attracting serious interest going into production.

The name comes from one of their first widely known products and is a portmanteau of the English words pen and pastel. Pentel is also the inventor of non-permanent marker technology. Most Pentel products are manufactured in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Mexico, and France. The company is regarded as the inventor of the fibre-tipped (felt-tip) pen in 1963. Nowadays, Pentel produces a wide range of products that include writing implements, art materials and office goods. History The company was founded in 1946 as \"Japan Stationery Limited\" (Nihonbungu Kabushiki Gaisha) in Tokyo by Yokio Horie, with the purpose of manufacturing crayons and pastels.

Johnson, who bought a dozen of them to sign photographs, apart from being adopted as the official writing instrument of NASA and going into space with a Gemini mission in 1966. Demand for a Sign Pen was so extraordinary that the Tokyo factories could not supply all requests. The Sign Pen was one of Pentel's most successful products with more than two billion units sold. In 1971 the company changed its name to \"Pentel Co. Ltd.\" and one year later, the green rollerball pen with water-based ink, was launched. Horie remained as President of the company until his death in 2010. In the 2010s, Pentel launched the \"Pocket Brush\", a fudepen that used replaceable waterproof ink cartridges, like fountain pens (and unlike conventional brush pens, which are more like marker pens.) Brush pens (designed and recommended for calligraphy) have also gained popularity among comic book artists, who choose them to ink their works instead of dip pens or traditional brushes. One of those artists using Pentel was Neal Adams.

Background Van Halen began recording demos in 1976. However, a three-track tape financed by Gene Simmons attracted no interest from record labels. Guitarist Eddie Van Halen was not convinced of the quality of the material because they could not make the recordings with their own equipment. Simmons left to tour with Kiss after recording the demos, but said he would try to secure Van Halen a record deal afterwards. After recording the demos, the band was offered several concerts. At a sold-out show in their hometown, Pasadena, the group's future manager, Marshall Berle, discovered the band. He and musical entrepreneur Kim Fowley paired them with punk rock band Venus and the Razorblades for a gig at the Whisky a Go Go. After being well received by Berle at the Whisky a Go Go, the band gained the attention of Mo Ostin and Ted Templeman of Warner Bros. Ostin and Templeman were impressed with the band's subsequent performance at the Starwood, and Van Halen proceeded to sign a contract with Warner. The recording of their debut album began August 29, 1977 and lasted three weeks. With producer Ted Templeman, it was mostly recorded live. \"Runnin' with the Devil\", \"Jamie's Cryin'\", \"Feel Your Love Tonight\" and \"Ice Cream Man\" contain guitar overdubs. Overall, the album cost approximately $40,000 to produce. \"We didn't have a ton of material,\" recalled bassist Michael Anthony, \"so we basically just took our live show and all the songs we knew and went for it. The whole album only took a couple of weeks. Ted Templeman wanted to make a big, powerful guitar record, and he had all he needed in what Eddie was doing.\" The subsequent tour began with the band opening for rock acts such as Journey and Montrose in the United States. They later opened for heavy metal band Black Sabbath in Europe and the United States. Packaging and artwork The cover photos for Van Halen were taken at the Whisky a Go Go, a Los Angeles club at which Van Halen often performed during the mid-1970s. The guitar pictured on the cover is Eddie Van Halen's signature Frankenstrat (before he added the red paint), a highly customized Stratocaster-style guitar built out of replacement parts. The liner notes thank radio disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer and Kiss bassist Gene Simmons, the latter usually credited with discovering Van Halen. \"A lot of people stick me on their [thanks list], even though I don't deserve it,\" Simmons remarked. \"One that I did deserve to be on was that first Van Halen record – the guys still owe me a couple thousand bucks!

Soon after its February 1978 release, Van Halen became regarded by fans and critics as one of rock and roll's greatest debut albums; however, its initial critical reception was mostly negative. In 1978, Rolling Stone critic Charles M. Young predicted, \"In three years, Van Halen is going to be fat and self-indulgent and disgusting ... follow[ing] Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin right into the toilet. In the meantime, they are likely to be a big deal.\" But he also wrote that: \"Van Halen's secret is not doing anything that's original while having the hormones to do it better than all those bands who have become fat and self-indulgent and disgusting. Edward Van Halen has mastered the art of lead/rhythm guitar in the tradition of Jimmy Page and Joe Walsh; several riffs on this record beat anything Aerosmith has come up with in years. Vocalist Dave Lee Roth manages the rare hard-rock feat of infusing the largely forgettable lyrics with energy and not sounding like a castrato at the same time. Drummer Alex Van Halen and bassist Michael Anthony are competent and properly unobtrusive.\" Village Voice critic Robert Christgau said, \"For some reason Warners wants us to know that this is the biggest bar band in the San Fernando Valley ... The term becomes honorific when the music belongs in a bar. This music belongs on an aircraft carrier.\" According to Rolling Stones Holly George-Warren, with the album's release the mainstream media focused on Roth's \"swaggering good looks and extroverted persona\", while fans and musicians \"were riveted by Eddie Van Halen's guitar mastery\", which included \"an array of unorthodox techniques.\" She notes that, even before the band's debut, \"Eddie became a legend among local guitarists.\" Kerrang! magazine gave the album a very positive review, and considers the album to be an \"essential purchase.\" They wrote, \"IT'S DIFFICULT to overstate the effect VH's debut had upon its release. With the music world split between punk, disco and prog rock, Van Halen combined a dazzling live show with a party-hearty motto and, in Eddie Van Halen, a guitarist who redefined what was possible on six strings. His sound on this album—christened 'The Brown Sound'—remains the holy grail of guitar tones.\" Record World called the single \"Jamie's Crying\" a \"driving rhythm piece, which may be [Van Halen's] most interesting single to date.\" saying that \"its rock energy never lets up.\" Commercial performance On August 7, 1996, Van Halen was re-certified by the RIAA for selling ten million copies in the United States alone. One of only six rock bands to release two RIAA Diamond status albums, Van Halen remains one of Van Halen's two best-selling albums, along with 1984. Van Halen went to Gold status on May 24, 1978, and then went to Platinum status just a few months later, on October 10, 1978.

In less than a year later, on July 11, 1994, the album went to 8x Multi-Platinum, and finally, on August 7, 1996, just two years later, the album went to Diamond status by RIAA. The Van Halen album, like Van Halen's other David Lee Roth-era albums—excepting Van Halen II, which was re-certified in 2004, to coincide with the promotion of a Warner Bros. Records greatest hits collection—was last brought by Warner Bros. Records to the RIAA for re-certification in 1996, while 1984 was re-certified on February 8, 1999. The band's split with Warner Brothers in 2002, and subsequent agreement with Interscope has eliminated Warner Brothers' incentive for paying the [relatively substantial] fee to promote Van Halen's back-catalog by having its albums re-certified. Despite lack of re-certification, Van Halen's 1978 debut has continued to sell prolifically, re-appearing numerous times on the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top Pop Catalog Albums charts, as recently as 2020. Legacy AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Van Halen as \"monumental\" and \"seismic\", while noting that it is typically not viewed as an \"epochal generation shift\" in the same way as the debut albums of Led Zeppelin, the Ramones, The Rolling Stones, and the Sex Pistols. He explains, \"The reason it's never given the same due is that there's no pretension, nothing self-conscious about it.\" He commented: \"The still-amazing thing about Van Halen is how it sounds like it has no fathers ... Like all great originals Van Halen doesn't seem to belong to the past and it still sounds like little else, despite generations of copycats.\" In Erlewine's opinion, the album \"set the template for how rock and roll sounded for the next decade or more.\" A retrospective review by Q noted, \"Hit singles came later, but this dazzling debut remains their trump card.\" In 1994, Van Halen was ranked number eight in Colin Larkin's Top 50 Heavy Metal Albums. Larkin described it as \"one of the truly great\" debut albums of heavy metal. According to authors Gary Graff and Daniel Durchholz, writing in MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide (1999), Van Halen is a \"headbanger's paradise\"; before its release, \"no one had heard or seen anything like it.\" In 2003, Rolling Stone, listed it among The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, at number 410; the list's 2012 edition had it ranked 415th. The 2020 list placed it at 292. According to Rolling Stones Joe Levy, the album \"gave the world a new guitar hero and charismatic frontman\" in Eddie Van Halen and David Lee Roth, respectively. Levy credits the tracks \"Runnin' with the Devil\" and \"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\" with \"put[ting] the swagger back in hard rock\", praising Eddie Van Halen's \"jaw-dropping technique\", which \"raised the bar for rock guitar.\" In 2006, Guitar World readers ranked it number 7 on a list of the Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time.

World's first computer-controlled business telephone systems French IBM engineers developed the world's first computer-controlled business telephone systems at IBM La Gaude near Nice in France. 1962 laboratory relocation from Paris to near Nice IBM moved its French research and product-development laboratory from Paris to a spectacular, purpose-built, 35,000 square-metre building, designed by the architect Marcel Breuer, in 23 hectares of rough countryside near the village of La Gaude overlooking Nice and Nice airport. IBM chose the location because it could attract the cream of French engineers to work on the French Riviera, it was close to France's second-largest airport, and because it complied with the French government's policy to decentralize from Paris and build away from urban centres. Initially 700 people, mostly engineers, worked there. By 1987 there were 1,500 engineers in the original B1 building. The B2 building was built in 1969 and B3 (with a patio) in 1978. From 1984 to 1986 reinforcements were made to reduce the risk of earthquake damage. Staff included IBM employees from other European countries and the USA. In 2015 most staff were displaced to a new centre nearer Nice. Products IBM La Gaude developed telecommunication products for IBM's worldwide markets. For European markets there were the IBM 1750, 2750 and 3750 Switching Systems (world-wide the first electronic computer-controlled business telephone systems widely called PABXs — Private Automatic Branch Exchanges). For world markets La Gaude engineers developed the IBM 270x series of communication controllers, modems, and other IBM products.

The book discusses the history of black political thought from Martin Delany to Malcolm X and extrapolates a new theory for black political solidarity consistent with liberal values of individual liberty, social equality, and cultural tolerance. Orlando Patterson described the book as \"contest[ing] the movement's central claims at a level of sociophilosophical sophistication that one rarely encounters.\" Bill Lawson, in his review of Shelby's book in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews, described it as a \"provocative and insightful book.\" He continued, \"Professor Shelby has done a great service to both philosophical and historical academic studies... What makes this book worth reading beyond the scholarship and its scholarly insights is Professor Shelby's attempt to move Black Nationalism into the post-civil rights era.\" Shelby is also the co-editor of Hip-Hop and Philosophy: Rhyme 2 Reason with Derrick Darby. In his review of the book, Tommy J. Curry said that it is \"...a great work that inhabits the tension between the sterile thought of the academy and the rich lives of many young urban Americans.\" Shelby also co-edited Transition 99 with Henry Louis Gates Jr., K.

She was also called Vlasta and was supporter of the mythical Bohemian Princess Libuše. Life On the death of Libuše ca. 738, Valasca seized power and created a state ruled by women. She decreed that only women were to receive military training and that boys were to be maimed to render them unable to fight by removal of the right eye and thumb. She supposedly distributed a potion to the women of Bohemia which protected them from men. She was slain by Primislaus in battle after seven years of rule, at which point men regained power. Her headquarters were traditionally believed to have been located in Dívčí Hrad (\"The Virgin’s Castle\") on Mount Vidovole In popular culture A character called Velasca in popular TV series Xena: Warrior Princess was loosey based on Valasca.

The borough was formed in 2010 as a merger of the former boroughs Oud-Zuid and Zuideramstel. The borough has almost 138,000 inhabitants (2013). With 8,500 homes per square kilometer, it is one of the most densely populated boroughs of Amsterdam. It has the highest income per household of all boroughs in Amsterdam. History Amsterdam-Zuid is the borough of Amsterdam situated to the south and southwest of the Singelgracht canal, along the Stadhouderskade city ring road. It is bordered by the Vondelpark in the northwest, the Westlandgracht canal in the west, the Amstel river in the east and the Kalfjeslaan in the south, which also forms the border with the municipality of Amstelveen. The Singelgracht canal had been Amsterdam's city border since the 17th century, when the Amsterdam canal belt was constructed. The taking down of the wall surrounding the Singelgracht, the outer canal, in the second half of the 19th century allowed for the development of new residential areas. South of the former wall, the first neighborhoods to develop were the Oude Pijp neighborhood, the neighborhood surrounding the Rijksmuseum, and the Willemspark neighborhood. This area is now also known as Oud Zuid ('Old South'). In 1917, the area was further developed southwards on the basis of Plan Zuid, the ambitious urban expansion plan designed by Dutch architect and city planner Hendrik Petrus Berlage. Berlage's plan included wide streets lined with four-story apartment blocks for the middle class. The plan also included public art to be installed in the new residential areas. Between 1920 and 1940, the Plan Zuid neighborhoods of Nieuwe Pijp, Diamantbuurt, Rivierenbuurt, Stadionbuurt and Apollobuurt were constructed, with many buildings designed in Amsterdam School style. This area is also known as Nieuw Zuid ('New South'). Another neighborhood built in the 1920s is the Hoofddorppleinbuurt, west of the Schinkel river. This neighborhood is part of Plan West, another urban expansion plan by Berlage which was designed for the western area of the city on the territory of the former municipality of Sloten. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Buitenveldert neighborhood and the smaller Prinses Irenebuurt became the last major residential developments in the southern part of the",

The A10 motorway, which runs through the southern borough, was constructed in 1962. In 1978, the first section of the Weesp–Leiden railway and the Amsterdam Zuid railway station opened along the southern part of the A10 motorway. In the 1990s and 2000s, the area surrounding the railway station became the rapidly developing business district of Zuidas. Borough government Until 2014, the Amsterdam boroughs, called stadsdelen or 'districts', were governed by a directly elected district council (deelraad) as well as a separate district executive board, the members of which were appointed and controlled by the council. Since the 2014 municipal elections, the district councils have been abolished and replaced by smaller, but still directly elected district committees (bestuurscommissies). The district committees are elected every four years, on the same day as the city's central municipal council. Each district committee elects three of its members to form an executive committee (dagelijks bestuur). The district committees' jurisdiction is determined by the central municipal council. Responsibilities delegated to the 2014–2018 district committees include parks and recreation, streets and squares, refuse collection, permits and events, preparation of zoning plans, passports and drivers licenses, and welfare work. The district committee of Amsterdam-Zuid consists of 15 members. The committee was elected on 19 March 2014. Five national political parties and two local parties are represented in the committee. On 7 April 2014, after three weeks of coalition talks, the committee elected its executive committee. Executive committee chair is Sebastiaan Capel (D66), the other members are Paul Slettenhaar (VVD) and Marijn van Ballegooijen (PvdA) The borough office (stadsdeelkantoor or 'district office') of Amsterdam-Zuid is located at President Kennedylaan 923, near the Amsterdam RAI Exhibition and Convention Centre.

P. Bulmer of Hereford. It is one of the biggest selling British bottled cider brands in the UK because it has the highest concentration of apples, with a number of variants including Bulmers Original & Pear. It should not be confused with Bulmers Irish Cider, sold outside the Republic of Ireland as Magners. History Fred and Percy Bulmer grew the apples at their family orchard at Credenhill in Herefordshire which would be later used to make the cider for which they became known. Production was initially at Ryelands Street in Hereford, the original buildings, including cider cellars survives today as the Cider Museum and King Offa Distillery. Production moved to the current Plough Lane site in the late 1970s. Today HP Bulmer makes 65% of the UK's five hundred million litres of cider sold annually, and the bulk of the UK's cider exports. From 1937 to 1949, Bulmers operated with Wm. Magners of Clonmel, expanding into Irish distribution markets. From 1949 Magners withdrew from this partnership but retained rights to trade under the name HP Bulmer Ltd in Ireland. In 2003, the Hereford-based firm was bought for £278 million by Scottish & Newcastle (S&N) with the loss of some 200 jobs initially. In 2008, S&N were bought for £7.8 billion by the Carlsberg and Heineken groups. Bulmers now only survives as a brand name and subsidiary of the Dutch Heineken group, with operations in Hereford scaled back to focus mainly on the production of cider. During spring 2006, the company relaunched Bulmers Original in the UK, aimed at the \"served over ice\" market, which had grown in popularity over the past few years. Bulmers Original is a 4.5% ABV cider, primarily sold in pint bottles (568 ml). In November 2007, Bulmers pear cider was launched. In summer 2011, Bulmers relaunched with a new look and new bottles. In reference to the Bulmers naming tradition dating back to the early 1900s (at the time these were Bulmers 1 through to 8), they number-coded the then-current and all future varieties with Original as \"No. 9\", Pear as \"No. 10\" and Crisp Blend as \"No. 15\". At the same time, the Red Berry and Lime flavour was launched as \"No. 17\". In March 2013, two new flavours; \"Bulmers Cider Bold Black Cherry\" and \"Bulmers Cider Pressed Red Grape\", number-coded \"No. 19\" and \"No. 20\" respectively, were added to the range. In March 2014, two lower-alcohol flavours were added: Bulmers Cider Five Fruit Harvest and Bulmers Cider Indian Summer, number-coded \"No. 21\" and \"No. 22\" and with an ABV of 2.8%. In 2015, the red grape flavour was discontinued and replaced with a new flavour \"Zesty Blood Orange\", number-coded as \"No. 23\".

Ingredients In 2014, a study by The Daily Telegraph found that a pint of Bulmers cider contained five teaspoons (20.5g) of sugar, nearly as much as the WHO recommends as an adult's daily allowance of added sugar, and 5-10 times the sugar of lager or ale. By law, all cider produced in the UK must contain a minimum of 35% apple juice, but this can be imported concentrate. Bulmers do not disclose the percentage of apple juice in their product. Current range There are currently only two flavours. Bulmers Original Cider Bulmers Crushed Red Berries and Lime Cider Orchard Pioneers: Kier's Cloudy Apple Cider Orchard Pioneers: Sarah's Red Apple Cider Limited edition variants Bulmers have produced several limited edition flavours: Bulmers Light, introduced in Spring 2008, had the same ABV as Bulmers Original but with 30% fewer calories. However this was delisted a year later due to poor sales. In Summer 2010, a limited edition version was made, combining both apple and pear flavours in one and named 'Summer Blend'. In Autumn 2010, another limited edition version was created, made using Katy apples which are allowed to fully ripen in the orchards before harvesting, and named \"Red Apple\". In the Summer 2011, Bulmers released the limited edition \"Crisp Blend\" which is made from sharper tasting apples, with a crisp and slightly drier flavour than Original. It was available in pint bottles only. To celebrate the 125th anniversary of the brand in 2012, Bulmers released Bulmers Vintage Reserve (\"No 18\"), made with 100% bittersweet apples from the previous year's crop.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 69,698, up from 67,531 at the 2010 census. Its county seat is Lake City. Columbia County comprises the Lake City, FL Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Gainesville-Lake City, FL Combined Statistical Area. Osceola National Forest is partially in Columbia County. History After Florida became a territory of the United States in 1821, pioneer and immigrant settlers from the United States formed their own settlement adjacent to a Seminole village called Alligator Village, and called it Alligator. Following the 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek, the residents of Alligator village relocated to the banks of Peace Creek in the newly established Seminole reservation, leaving Alligator Town on its own. When Columbia County was formed in 1832 from Duval and Alachua counties, Alligator Town was designated as the seat of the county government.",

The county was developed for agriculture and the timber industry, with products such as turpentine, lumber, and plywood. From 1832 to 1839, the county seat was Newnansville, but that town and area were returned to Alachua County. In November 1858 a railroad was completed connecting Jacksonville to Alligator, which opened the town to more commerce and passenger traffic. Alligator Town was incorporated and its name changed to Lake City in 1859; M. Whit Smith was elected as the town's first mayor. According to an urban legend, the name was changed because the mayor's wife Martha Jane, who had recently moved to the town, refused to hang her lace curtains in a town named Alligator. During the American Civil War, the railroad between Lake City and Jacksonville was used to send beef and salt to Confederate soldiers. In February 1864 Union troops under Truman Seymour advanced west from Jacksonville. His objective was to disrupt Confederate supplies, and obtain African-American recruits and supplies. Confederate General Joseph Finnegan assembled troops and called for reinforcements from P. G. T. Beauregard in response to the Union threat. On February 11, 1864, Finnegan's troops defeated a Union cavalry raid in Lake City. After the Union cavalry was repulsed, Finnegan moved his forces to Olustee Station about ten miles east of Lake City. The Confederate presence at Olustee Station was reinforced to prepare for the Union troops coming from Jacksonville. Union forces engaged the Confederates at the Battle of Olustee on February 20, 1864, near the Olustee Station. It was the only major battle in Florida during the war. Union casualties were 1,861 men killed, wounded or missing; Confederate casualties were 946 killed, wounded or missing. The Confederate dead were buried in Lake City. In 1928 a memorial for the Battle of Olustee was established in downtown Lake City. Lake City's first newspaper was published in 1874, called the Lake City Reporter. Charles H. Thompson, an African American minister, represented Columbia County in the Florida House of Representatives and served as a county commissioner in 1874 and 1875.In 1876 the Bigelow Building was completed; it later was adapted for use as the City Hall. The first fire department was established in 1883 to complement the police department. In 1891 Lake City became the first city in Florida to have electric lights from a local power and light company. White violence rose against blacks in the late 19th century in a regionwide effort to establish and maintain white supremacy as Southern states disenfranchised most blacks and imposed Jim Crow. Whites lynched 20 African Americans in Columbia County from 1877 to 1950, mostly in the decades near the turn of the 20th century. It was tied with Polk County for the second-highest total of lynchings of any county in the state. Among these murders was the mass lynching on May 21, 1911, of six black men who were taken from the jail by a white mob in Lake City. They were being held on charges of murdering one white",

Countries with fewer than three finishers were not ranked. The race was won by Wang Xiuting of China, who had been runner-up to Ingrid Kristiansen the previous year. She ran 49:34 minutes to finish ten seconds ahead of the runner-up, teammate Zhong Huandi, with former champion Aurora Cunha of Portugal in third place. With Wang Huabi in seventh, the Chinese team achieved a championship record-low score of ten points. The Portuguese women achieved the lowest non-winning score in championship history, with 15 points, with Cunha being followed home by fourth placed Albertina Machado and Albertina Dias in eighth Showing the dominance of the race by a handful of nations, a Yekaterina Khramenkova-led Soviet Union also achieved the lowest ever score for third place on 24 points.

At the 1974 World Championships in Munich, he placed first in figures, second in the short program, and fifth in the free skate. Technically gifted, he landed a triple Lutz in the free skate, the most difficult triple jump done at the time. Finishing ahead of Volkov and Canada's Toller Cranston, he stood atop the world podium for the first time. Later that year, he injured his knee on the trampoline. He had surgery on his meniscus and subsequently missed the entire 1974–75 season. Hoffmann finished fourth at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck after placing fourth in figures, ninth in the short program, and fifth in the free skate. At the 1979 European Championships in Zagreb, Hoffmann finished ahead of the Soviet Union's Vladimir Kovalyov and the United Kingdom's Robin Cousins to win his fourth continental title. He took bronze behind the same skaters at the 1979 World Championships in Vienna. In January 1980, Hoffmann placed second to Cousins at the European Championships in Gothenburg. The 1980 Winter Olympics took place in February in Lake Placid, New York. In his fourth Olympics, Hoffmann ranked first in figures, second in the short, and second in the free, winning the silver medal behind Cousins and ahead of Charles Tickner of the United States. At these Games, he became the first man to land a triple lutz jump in the Olympics. He ended his amateur career in March at the 1980 World Championships in Dortmund. Ranked first in figures and second in the next two segments, he finished ahead of Cousins and Tickner and was awarded his second World title. Post-competitive Hoffmann studied medicine and became an orthopaedic specialist. He served on the managing board of the Deutsche Eislauf-Union and has appeared as a figure skating judge. He judged the ladies' event at the 1994 Winter Olympics and was one of five judges who placed Oksana Baiul ahead of Nancy Kerrigan.

Combining such data sets can enable accounting for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of traditional life-cycle assessments. EIO-LCA analysis traces out the various economic transactions, resource requirements and environmental emissions (including all the various manufacturing, transportation, mining and related requirements) required for producing a particular product or service. EIO-LCA relies on sector-level averages that may or may not be representative of the specific subset of the sector relevant to a particular product. To the extent that the good or service of interest is representative of a sector, EIO-LCA can provide very fast estimates of full supply chain implications for that good or service. Background Economic input-output analysis was developed by the Nobel Prize-winning economist Wassily Leontief. It quantifies the interrelationships among sectors of an economic system, enabling identification of direct and indirect economic inputs of purchases. This concept was extended by including data about environmental and energy analysis from each sector to account for supply chain environmental implications of economic activity. Theory Input-output transactions tables, which track flows of purchases between sectors, are collected by the federal government in the United States. EIO works as follows: If represents the amount that sector purchased from sector in a given year and is the \"final demand\" for output from sector (i.e., the amount of output purchased for consumption, as opposed to purchased by other businesses as supplies for more production), then the total output from sector includes output to consumers plus output sold to other sectors: If we define as the normalized production for each sector, so that , then In vector notation This result indicates that knowing only the final demand from each sector and the normalized IO matrix , one can calculate the total implied production from each sector of the economy. If data are available on a particular emissions release (or other attribute of interest) from each sector of the economy, then a matrix can be compiled to represent various releases (columns) per $ output from each sector (rows). Total additional emissions associated with additional final demand of can then be calculated as: This simple result enables very quick analysis, taking into account releases associated with the entire supply chain requirements needed to provide a specific final demand, on average. The equations are based on average data in the current economy, but they can be used to make predictions for marginal changes in output (such as one more unit of a particular product) if average output and marginal output",

Finally, if the researcher has estimates for valuation of externality costs associated with each item in (or, alternatively, if weighting coefficients are available that represent the relative importance of each item in , using ecological indicators, for example) then the externality costs (or weights) per unit of releases could be compiled into a vector in order to calculate the scalar \"environmental impact metric\" : Generally there is wide uncertainty associated with estimates of , so such aggregation should be done only with care, including sensitivity analysis. Typically, researchers examine specific elements of rather than attempting to aggregate. The big picture result is that by collecting data on average economic sector transactions and average sector emissions , it is possible to make quick predictions about the full supply chain emissions associated with a product of interest by representing the product as marginal changes in production from relevant sectors . Software Researchers at the Green Design Institute of Carnegie Mellon University began developing a web-based tool for performing an EIO-LCA in the 1990s. The underlying software traces out the various economic transactions, resource requirements and environmental emissions associated with the production of a particular product or service. The model captures all the various manufacturing, transportation, mining and related requirements to produce a product or service. For example, one might wish to trace out the implications of purchasing $ 46,000 of reinforcing steel and $ 104,000 of concrete for a kilometer of roadway pavement. Environmental implications of these purchases can be estimated using EIO-LCA. The current (2002) model is based upon the Department of Commerce's 428 sector industry input-output model of the US economy. In 2018, VitalMetrics Group, an environmental consultancy, developed a web-based Spend Analysis Tool for quantifying the environmental impacts associated with an organization’s entire upstream supply chain. It is compliant with the approach for quantifying spend-based impacts defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain Accounting and Reporting Standard. The tool utilizes the Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive (CEDA), a peer-reviewed EIO-LCA database with a base year of 2014. CEDA represents 389 industrial sectors, the commodities and the linkages between them, and over 2,700 environmental exchanges arising from them, including extraction of various natural resources, water consumption, land use, and emissions to air, water and soil This article uses text from Design Decisions Wiki under the GFDL.

The party is led by Iurie Leancă, who was Prime Minister of Moldova from 2013 to 2015. For the duration of this premiership, Leancă was a member of the Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova (PLDM). History The government of Moldova which emerged from coalition talks after the 2014 parliamentary election did not command a parliamentary majority and relied on support from the Moldovan Communist party (PCRM). The PLDM, led by former Prime Minister Vlad Filat, conceded Leancă's departure from office to the PCRM as part of this arrangement. Leancă, who was elected on the PLDM list, resigned from the party in response and launched the PPEM to continue advocating positions, notably Pro-Europeanism, he feels his former party has failed to uphold by entering into informal cooperation with Moldova's Communist Party. Besides Leancă, former deputy Prime Minister Eugen Carpov and Nicolae Juravschi are the party's other MPs. The party participated in the 2015 local election as the European People's Platform Electoral Bloc — Iurie Leancă with the Liberal Reformist Party, Democratic Action and Democracy at Home Party. Ideology The party leadership has expressed opposition to Moldova's communist legacy and opposes even informal cooperation with communist parties From this perspective anti-communism can be seen as part of the PPEM's platform.

Vibia Perpetua was a recently married, well-educated noblewoman, said to have been 22 years old at the time of her death, and mother of an infant son she was nursing. Felicity, a slave woman imprisoned with her and pregnant at the time, was martyred with her. They were put to death along with others at Carthage in the Roman province of Africa. The Passion of Perpetua and Felicity narrates their death. According to the passion narrative, five people were arrested and executed at the military games in celebration of the Emperor Septimius Severus's birthday. Along with Felicitas and Perpetua, these included two free men, Saturninus and Secundulus, and an enslaved man named Revocatus; all were catechumens or Christians being instructed in the faith but not yet baptized. To this group of five was added a further man named Saturus, who voluntarily went before the magistrate and proclaimed himself a Christian. Perpetua's first person narrative was published posthumously as part of the Passion. Imprisonment Perpetua's account opens with conflict between her and her father, who wishes her to recant her belief. Perpetua refuses, and is soon baptized before being moved to prison. Perpetua was imprisoned in Carthage in the days leading up to her martyrdom. She described these days and what she endured in her diary. Perpetua described the physical and emotional torments that she suffered in the prison leading up to her martyrdom. Perpetua suffered physically due to the heat, rough prison guards, and the cessation of regular breastfeeding. Perpetua also described how the prison conditions improved after she was able to bribe the guards so that she and the other martyrs were moved to another part of the prison, with her infant. Her physical torment was also eased after she was able to breastfeed her child. Perpetua described bodily ailments in detail and the most common in her narrative was the cycle of pain and relief she would feel in her breasts. At the encouragement of her brother, Perpetua asks for and receives a vision, in which she climbs a dangerous ladder to which various weapons are attached. At the foot of a ladder is a serpent, which is faced first by Saturus and later by Perpetua. The serpent does not harm her, and she ascends to a garden. At the conclusion of her dream, Perpetua realizes that the martyrs will suffer. The day before her martyrdom, Perpetua envisions herself defeating a savage Egyptian and interprets this to mean that she would have to do battle not merely with wild beasts, but with the Devil himself. Veneration In Carthage a basilica was erected over the tomb of the martyrs, the Basilica Maiorum, where an ancient inscription bearing the names of Perpetua and Felicitas has been found. Saints Felicitas and Perpetua are among the martyrs commemorated by name in the Roman Canon of the Mass. The feast day of Saints Perpetua and Felicitas, 7 March, was celebrated across the Roman Empire and was entered in the Philocalian Calendar, the 4th-century calendar of martyrs",

Born to former Indian test cricketer Bharath Reddy, Sriya worked as successful video jockey at SS Music before pursuing an acting career as well. Following her debut in Samurai (2002), she appeared in nearly a dozen Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam films, with Black (2004), Thimiru (2006) and Kanchivaram (2008) being her best known productions. Early life Sriya was born into a Telugu family to Bharath Reddy, an Indian cricketer. She did her schooling at Good Shepherd School and went on to study at Ethiraj College Chennai. When she was a child, cricketers Ravi Shastri and Sandeep Patil visited their home and complimented her good voice. During school, she received modelling offers, but had to decline them, since her father wanted her to finish her education first. When she was offered an audition for the leading music channel Southern Spice Music, she was able to convince her father that she would both study and be a VJ. Career Sriya, after winning the VJ hunt by SS Music, started hosting shows such as Connect and Phonetastic. However, she cited that she needed five auditions before being selected. She became highly popular as 'VJ Sriya' on SS music, becoming familiar among young viewers. She then accepted her first acting assignment for a Telugu film, in spite of her parents' aversion to her acting in films, citing that she signed the contract when her father was asleep. Her debut release, however, happened to be Balaji Sakthivel's directorial debut Samurai, in which she played a supporting character alongside Vikram.

Her next release was in 2004, when she debuted in Malayalam with the Mammootty-starrer Black. She played the role of a young Tamil village woman who comes to town in search of her missing husband, carrying a \"thoroughly de-glamourised look\" in the film, totally contrary to her real-life look, with director Renjith, on his decision to cast her for the role, citing that she had a \"very Dravidian face\". Sriya considered this film as her highest point of career for having acted alongside Malayalam actor Mammootty. Later that year, she also starred in an English film named 19 Revolutions, directed by Chicago-based Shridhar Reddy, which featured Sriya as a rich girl who wants to rob her father and did \"very well in the US\", according to Sriya.

Dogs demonstrate a wide range of coat colors, patterns, textures, and lengths. As with other mammals, a dog's fur has many uses, including thermoregulation and protection from cuts or scratches; furthermore, a dog's coat plays an important role in the showing of purebred dogs. Breed standards often include a detailed description of the nature and attributes of that breed's ideal coat. A dog's coat is composed of two layers: a top coat of stiff guard hairs that help repel water and shield from dirt, and an undercoat of soft down hairs, to serve as insulation. Dogs with both under coat and top coat are said to have a double coat. Dogs with a single coat have a coat composed solely of guard hairs, with little or no downy undercoat. The terms fur and hair are often used interchangeably when describing a dog's coat, however in general, a double coat, like that of the Newfoundland and most livestock guardian dogs, is referred to as a fur coat, while a single coat, like that of the Poodle, is referred to as a hair coat. Genetics Domestic dogs exhibit diverse coat colours and patterns. In many mammals, different colour patterns are the result of the",

        "prompt": "of the Agouti gene, which can cause hair follicles to switch from making black or brown pigments to yellow or nearly white pigments. The most common coat pattern found in modern wolves is agouti, in which the upperside of the body has banded hairs and the underside exhibits lighter shading. The colour yellow is dominant to the colour black and is found in dogs across much of the world and the dingo in Australia. In 2021, a study of whole genome sequences taken from dogs and wolves focused on the genetic relationships between them based on coat colour. The study found that most dog colour haplotypes were similar to most wolf haplotypes, however dominant yellow in dogs was closely related to white in arctic wolves from North America. This result suggests a common origin for dominant yellow in dogs and white in wolves but without recent gene flow, because this clade was found to be genetically basal to the golden jackal and genetically distinct from all other canids. The most recent common ancestor of the golden jackal and the wolf lineage dates back to 2 million years ago. The study proposes that 35,000 years ago there was genetic introgression into the Late Pleistocene grey wolf from a ghost population of an extinct canid which had diverged from the grey wolf lineage over 2 million years ago. This colour diversity could be found 35,000 years ago in wolves and 9,500 years ago in dogs. A closely related haplotype exists among those wolves of Tibet which possess yellow shading in their coats. The study explains the colour relationships between modern dogs and wolves, white wolves from North America, yellow dogs, and yellowish wolves from Tibet. The study concludes that during the Late Pleistocene, natural selection laid the genetic foundation for modern coat colour diversity in dogs and wolves. During evolution of the dog from their wolf ancestors, coat colors in dogs were probably the inadvertent outcome of some other selective process, and were not likely initially selected for intentionally by humans. Research has found that tameness brings associated physical changes, including coat colouring and patterning. Domestic dogs often display the remnants of countershading, a common natural camouflage pattern. The basic principle of countershading is when the animal is lit from above, shadows will be cast on the ventral side of the body. These shadows could provide a predator or prey with visual cues relating to the movement of the animal. By being lighter colored on the ventral side of the body, an animal can counteract this, and thereby fool the predator or prey. An alternative explanation is that the dorsal and ventral sides of an animal experience different selection pressures (from the need to blend into different backgrounds when viewed from above and below) resulting in differing coloration.

Sedge and deadgrass are used to describe the desired Chesapeake Bay Retriever color that resembles \"that of its working surroundings\" as closely as possible. Red Red refers to reddish shades of orange, brown, and tan. Terms used include orange, red-gold, cinnamon, tan, and ruby. Genetically a dog called red is usually a clear sable (with little to no eumelanin tipping on hairs) or a ruddy recessive yellow. In some breeds, \"red\" refers to what would usually be called brown, chocolate, or liver. A \"red merle\" is always a liver-based merle. In Australian Cattle Dogs, \"blue\" stands for a densely ticked liver-based colouration with an overall red-grey appearance. Gold and yellow Gold refers specifically to a rich reddish-yellow and its variants, whereas yellow can refer to any shade of yellow and tan. Terms used include yellow-gold, lion-colored, fawn, apricot, wheaten, tawny, straw, yellow-red, mustard, sandy, honey, blond, and lemon. Dogs called golden or yellow tend to be recessive yellow, but can also be sable. Cream Cream refers to a pale yellowish or tannish colour which can be almost white. Fawn Fawn typically refers to a yellow, tan, light brown, or cream dog that has a dark melanistic mask. With Weimaraners, fawn refers to their typical brownish grey colouration that with other breeds is usually called lilac. Black Black is a pure black that can get grizzled as the dog ages, or have a tendency to gain a brownish cast when exposed to the elements. Blue Blue is a cool-toned, metallic grey. It typically means a d/d dilution of black pigment, a grey colouration that is grey from birth, but has a wide range of breed-specific meanings. In Kerry Blue Terriers, Poodles, and Bearded Collies, \"blue\" refers to colouration that is black at birth and progressively greys out as the dog matures. In Australian Shepherds, Rough Collies, and Shetland Sheepdogs, blue means a blue (black-based) merle. In Australian Silky Terriers, blue means a saddle-type black and tan pattern, where the black parts of the coat progressively fade to a steel grey as the dog matures and in Australian Cattle Dogs, blue stands for a densely ticked black-based colouration with an overall blue-grey appearance. Grey Grey simply means a grey colouration of any shade. It can be used as an alternative synonym of blue, but tends to mean some other type of grey than the d/d dilution of black. Synonyms include silver, pepper, grizzle, slate, blue-black grey, black and silver, steel. Greys of a dusty or brownish cast are often lilac, a d/d dilution of liver, and this colouration does not have much of a commonly recognised name. Across various breeds, it is called lavender, silver-fawn, isabella, fawn, café au lait or silver beige.

White White: Such a light cream that it is seen and described as pure white, making them distinct from albino dogs. A white dog, as opposed to an albino one, has dark pigment around the eye rims and nose, often coupled with dark-colored eyes. There is often some coat identifiable as cream between the dog's shoulder blades. Extreme piebald dogs can also appear all white, but are caused by a separate factor. Patterns The same pattern may be referred to differently in different breeds. Length and texture Dogs demonstrate an enormous diversity in coat length and texture, from the very short and smooth coat seen in the vizslas, to the wiry coat of a Scottish Terrier and the corded coat of the Puli and the Komondor. Generally, coats vary along three categories: length (long vs. short), texture (curly vs. straight), and coarseness (wire-haired vs. non-wire). These three categories all interact with one another; thus, one can see a short, curly, and wired coat in the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, and a long, straight, and non-wired coat in the Pomeranian. Additionally, breeds show variation in patterns of growth - that is to say, parts of the dog's body where the coat may be longer or shorter. The same gene that controls wiriness of hair also causes furnishings to be present (e.g. beard, moustache, eyebrows) - compare the bearded collie, furnishings present, to the border collie, which lacks furnishings. Some breeds show feathering: fringes of longer hair on the ears, belly, tail, and back of the legs (e.g., Saluki and any of the setters). Dogs also vary in the thickness of the undercoat. Some dogs have only a single (rather than a double) coat, or a very reduced undercoat (e.g. the Vizsla), which results in a thinner coat. Certain breeds, especially spitz-type breeds, tend to have a thicker undercoat, which helps retain heat in cold and wet weather. Furthermore, complete hairlessness on parts of the body is present in breeds such as the Chinese Crested or the Xoloitzcuintli. Shedding Shedding of hair can occur continuously, but in many breeds is strongly influenced by hormones. Seasonal shedders shed most in spring and fall, following an increase or decrease in day length, and least in summer and winter, in response to constant day length. Cold temperatures stimulate hair growth, so that the heaviest shedding is in spring on dogs living in cold climates. Artificial lighting can alter the seasonal shedding pattern of dogs who live indoors. Other hormonal influences include dietary factors, reproductive hormones in intact dogs, and various medical conditions and disorders. Shedding that is done in a short period of time is known as \"blowing the coat\" or \"blowing coat\". Among the other coat types, dogs with fine silky coats (e.g., spaniels) are generally moderate shedders, those with an intermediate coat texture (e.g., mountain dogs) are generally heavy shedders, and those with thick",

There are a few furnished breeds that shed more (e.g., Old English Sheepdog, Bearded Collie, Briard, Otterhound); at least one copy of the single-coat (non-shedding) allele - Most dogs with a smooth coat are low shedding, as well as the fringed or flat coat. There are breeds with a very short coat that shed more (e.g., Basset Hound, English Bulldog, Pug, Toy Fox Terrier, Dalmatian, Vizsla, German Shorthaired Pointer); single coat (no undercoat) plus furnishings (homozygous) - These breeds shed the least (e.g., Poodle, Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier). Hypoallergenic coat \"[D]ogs are a relevant source of allergens, but diagnosing dog-related allergies may present difficulties ..\" Some dog breeds have been promoted as hypoallergenic (which means less allergic, not free of allergens) because they shed very little. However, no canine is known to be completely nonallergenic. Often the problem is with the dog's saliva or dander, not the fur. Although breeds such as poodles, bedlingtons, bichons, yorkies, and wire-haired terriers are commonly represented as being hypoallergenic due to reduced shedding, the reaction that an individual person has to an individual dog may vary greatly. In a report, describing dog allergen extracts of dog hair, belonging to patients' dogs or from dogs of the same breed, with low molecular mass that are absent in extracts of commercial allergen test kits, it has been found that \"[f]actors related to individual dogs seem to influence the allergenicity more than breed or gender.\" Show coats The nature and quality of a purebred dog's coat is important to the dog fancy in the judging of the dog at conformation shows. The exact requirements are detailed in each breed's breed standard and do not generalise in any way, and the terminology may be very different even when referring to similar features. See individual breed articles for specific information. Nutritional impacts on coat A dog's coat is an outward indicator of internal well-being. For this reason, coat health is an important aspect of pet care to many dog owners. Dog coats can be impacted by nutritional components from the diet. Below is a table that summarizes the effects of several nutrients (minerals, vitamins) on the domestic canine coat, based on current evidence: Trace minerals Zinc Zinc contributes to hair growth and can prevent hair from becoming dry and brittle. In addition to, zinc when supplemented in combination with linoleic acids has been found to improve the coat of canines by reducing water loss in the trans-epidermal layer of the skin. Dogs can obtain zinc in their diet, through the addition of various ingredients, including; red meats, whole grains, poultry by-product meals, and fish meals. Copper Copper is a trace",

In dogs, a lack of copper in the diet, leading to a copper deficiency, results in incomplete keratinization. This leads to a dry coat, hypo-pigmentation, and discoloration of the coat. Selenium Selenium is another one of the many trace minerals essential for a dog's diet. Selenium is typically required in lower levels in comparison to other minerals. It is involved in the prevention of oxidative damage as well as the production of anti-oxidants. Selenium aids in the promotion of coat growth. Lack of selenium in the diet of a dog can contribute to the occurrence of sparse coat growth. Dogs can obtain selenium in their diet through the addition of various ingredients including; tuna fish, halibut, sardines, beef, chicken, and egg. Vitamins Vitamin A Vitamin A deficiency can lead to rough coat, scaling of skin, and other dermatitis issues like alopecia. It is also essential for cells to properly proliferate keratinocytes, which are epithelial cells that produce keratin on the outermost layer of the skin for the cortisol cells of the hair follicle. A deficiency in vitamin A can cause the common symptoms of dermatitis (dry, scaling skin and dull coat). Vitamin B7 (Biotin) Vitamin B7, also known as biotin, is a water-soluble nutrient that is known to play a role associated with the maintenance and development of hair starting from the follicle. Although it has not been clinically shown to improve hair growth with supplementation alone, it has been shown to reverse deficiency in dogs born deficient. Symptoms of biotin deficiency include alopecia and achromotrichia. A clinical study of biotin showed the importance of biotin in coat pigmentation. There different stages of hair development, as shown in clinical studies using mice. Each stage of hair development has a different sensitivity to biotin present in the body. For example, the shaft development is not greatly affected by biotin access. During the last stage, the amount of biotin available for use by the body will alter the success of that development greatly. Throughout the hair development, most stages of growth are completed, but it was found that in the last stage, where biotin levels were insufficient, there was an incorrect keratinization of the root of the hair, causing the hair to fall out of the body. The supplementation of biotin cannot reverse affects caused by deficiency, but as soon as supplementation is given and biotin levels are restored to adequacy, the body begins to produce the usual hair growth and color it would before the deficiency took place. Essential fatty acids Polyunsaturated fatty acids found in the diet play a critical role in the maintenance of a healthy coat in dogs, and have even been shown to improve coat condition when supplemented in the diet. Furthermore, diets lacking essential fatty acids in their diet will manifest as unkept, matted coat. Omega fatty acids 3 and 6 are highly unsaturated fatty acids, making them especially metabolically active. The proper combination of these omega fatty acids",

The National Research Council (NRC) recommends a 2.6:1 to 26:1 omega 6:3 ratio for adult dog maintenance diets. The proper ratio of these fatty acids is crucial because each has an opposing role in inflammation within the body and both compete for the same enzymatic pathway. Dogs, like many mammals, lack the desaturase enzymes capable of interconverting omega 3 and 6 fatty acids. Therefore, the amount of inflammation in the body is dependent on the ratio between omega 3 and 6 fatty acids. Too little inflammation suppresses the immune system and the body's ability to heal, however excessive inflammation can irritate the skin and reduce the coat's overall appearance. Aside from omega fatty acids, lipid content in the canine diet is an important aspect of coat health. The fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) require lipids present in the diet for absorption, transport and deposition in canine adipose tissue. The specific role of vitamins A and E for coat health are explored elsewhere in this article, as they pertain to immune function. Another pet food regulating body, the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), recommends that Vitamin E supplementation increase as polyunsaturated fatty acids are added to diet in order to counteract lipid oxidation and maintain the potency. In addition, high fat diets in dogs were shown to dramatically improve coat sheen and appearance. It is thought excess cholesterol esters are incorporated into the hair follicle, leading to the improved coat appearance. The same study, by Kirby, Hester and Bauer (2007), stated the optimal approach to an improved coat in dogs is a combination of increased dietary fat and the proper amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Omega 3 (linolenic acid) Omega 3 fatty acid, also known as linolenic acid, is an anti-inflammatory compound. Linolenic acid is found in the oil from flaxseeds, soybean and canola. Some better known examples of linolenic acid are the metabolic derivatives eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA). EPA inhibits the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, which prevents the synthesis of arachidonic acid which is an inflammatory omega 6. DHA acts even earlier in omega 6 metabolism, by inhibiting delta-6-desaturase. The anti-inflammatory properties of omega 3s stem from their ability to inhibit the inflammatory action of omega 6 fatty acids. A functional minimum has not been set forth by AAFCO, as one has yet to be determined. A reduction in inflammation of somatic tissues, skin especially, supports coat health. Omega 6 (linoleic acid) Omega 6 fatty acid, also known as linoleic acid, is found in poultry fat and the oil from safflower, sunflower, corn and flaxseed. Arachidonic acid is a well known metabolic derivative of linoleic acid, found only in animal sources. As mentioned above, arachindonic acid is a pro-inflammatory compound. It is critical to note once again that canines are unable to interconvert between omega fatty acids and over supplying linoleic acid promotes excessive inflammation in the body, which can potentially reverse",

The first explosion happened somewhere near a tent before the announcement of the winner of the match. After few seconds, another IED was exploded. One of the explosions was reportedly near a water pump at Rizal Plaza. According to Leyte Governor Dominic Petilla, in a Philippine Daily Inquirer report, 27 people were confirmed injured, mostly crowdgoers who watched the boxing match. Two people were in critical condition. The victims were brought to the Hilongos District Hospital and the Seventh Day Adventist Hospital to be given medical treatment. Perpetrators No individual or group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. President Rodrigo Duterte said on the same day of the blast, that the explosion was caused by rival drug syndicates involved in a turf war adding that Moros were also among the perpetrators. Duterte also stated that the attack could not be done by the New People's Army which had a ceasefire with the government at that time and reasoned that the communist group \"has no record of throwing grenades at innocent people\". The Armed Forces of the Philippines later said in December 29, that the bombing in Leyte was made by the Maute Group. It was speculated that the bombings were a retaliation to the arrest of an alleged drug trafficker and financier of the Maute Group in a drug bust operation conducted in the same town about two months earlier, on October 22, 2016 Philippine National Police chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa, also stated in December 29, that the bombs had \"signature of the BIFF\".

Synopsis Bob Reynolds is a young construction engineer, living with his pretty wife Jane in an old bungalow on Staten Island. He has become bitter because of his failure to get ahead and the fact that he is unable to get the clothes which he wishes for his wife. One night at the theater they witness the production of \"Paid in Full\" and Bob's sympathies are with the husband who succumbs to the temptation to steal, while Jane chides him, saying nothing should cause a man to be dishonest. A few days later Bob receives a letter from John Brand, a shrewd conscienceless capitalist whom he has known in college. He asks Bob to visit him and after chiding the young engineer for always playing the game straight, he makes him a proposition which he says will place him on easy street and enable him to buy Jane the fine feathers she should wear. He offers Bob a large sum for accepting an inferior grade of cement for a dam which Bob's company is constructing, and after a struggle with his conscience, the young man accepts. Two years pass and Bob and Jane enjoy the luxuries of the wealth that has come to them. Brand, however dislikes to see the young man enjoy the wealth and he persuades him to gamble in stocks which he manipulates until the young man is wiped out. Bob then sees himself for what he is, a sneak and a thief. The crash comes one evening while Mr. and Mrs. Brand are entertaining guests. Bob attempts to drown his sorrow in drink and then confesses his plight to Jane, seeking to lay his downfall on her. The memory of \"Paid in Full\" returns to Bob and he suggests that Jane go to Brand's apartments and plead with him. She accuses the man of deliberately ruining her husband and because he is fascinated with her, he consents to help them. But at this point word reaches them that the great dam with the inferior cement has broken and hundreds of persons have been swept to their doom. Bob confronts his wife with the news, insinuates she gave herself to Brand as payment for his help. She bitterly denies this, but in a drunken frenzy Bob goes to Brand's home, shoots him and then calling the police to tell them Brand has been killed, he places the gun to his own head and fires.

Fine Feathers was mostly shot in New York City in August, September and October 1920 at the Metro studios on 61st Street for the interiors. Some exterior scenes were shot on Staten Island, the Kensico reservoir was used as a location for the dam and one elaborate exterior crowd scene was shot in front of the Comedy Theatre on 41st Street. On August 7, 1920, the trade journal, The Moving Picture World breaks the news that \"Permission has been obtained from the city police and the fire departments by Fred H.

Principal photography ended at the beginning of October with exterior shots for Brand's home filmed at Billie Burke's \"summer place\", Burkeley Crest, now demolished and that was part of the Ziegfeld estate at Hastings-on-Hudson. The Visalia Times, a year after the Moving Picture World's article and 3 months after the release of the movie, reports on September 20, 1921, in a fairly detailed article that the Metro had built the facade of the Belasco in Yonkers for the theater scene. This is implausible for two reasons. One this was a movie made on a tight budget and building the facade of an entire building would have been prohibitively expensive but more importantly, there is at least one contemporaneous account of the overnight shoot in front of the Comedy Theatre.

To conform to the every little block of masonry in the dam, it was plastered together so to insure realism when the flood waters would start eating it away. The carefully constructed model was mounted on a large base with an outlet to carry off the water and two fire hoses trained on the back of the model. With the cameraman stationed close to the miniature, the water was turned on and as the basin began to fill the camera registered the growing flood. Under the force of the water the lightly plastered masonry started to crumble and with a rush the entire spillway gave way. The cameraman said the only casualty was his thoroughly drenched pants.

It is a tributary of the Pellice, which in turn is a tributary of the river Po. Although classified as a torrent, there is no period of the year at which the Chisone runs dry. Geography The stream is formed at the foot of Monte Barifreddo in the Cottian Alps and initially runs north-northwest through the Parco Naturale della Val Troncea. The course then follows a semi-circular path through the Val Chisone passing to the east, the north and then to the west of Monte Albergian. Near Perosa Argentina it receives the waters of the Germanasca, its main tributary. The Chisone enters the Pellice some to the east of Pinerolo, the most important of the settlements on its course. The valley formed by the river, running from Pragelato to the Po Valley, is known as Val Chisone.

Early career After graduating from the University of Bombay, Lule served as an apprentice to the Attorney General of India at the office in Mysore, India. He then returned to Uganda in 1962 having passed the bar exam in India at this point. He passed the bar examination of Uganda in 1967. Career Lule first entered Ugandan politics in 1963, when he began working for the State Attorney at the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs of Uganda. In 1964, he served in his first appointed position, appointed by Apollo Milton Obote to be the Assistant Administrator General in Kampala. Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs of Uganda In 1973, Idi Amin fired his Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs of Uganda, Peter James Nkambo Mugerwa, with the stated reason being that he could not keep up with the \"supersonic speed\" that President Idi Amin was driving the economy, leading him to appoint Godfrey Serunkuma Lule to be his successor. As Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs of Uganda, a position that also made him the Attorney General of Uganda, Lule dealt with the complicated legal justification of the unconstitutional actions of the increasingly erratic Idi Amin. He defended the 1975 Land Reform Decree 1975, which overhauled the country's land tenure system by overturning the Public Lands Act of 1969 and eliminating all private property in Uganda and making all land in Uganda to be public land owned by the government of Uganda, with land leased to private enterprises from the government of Uganda. He also had to deal with the legal consequences the Expulsion of Asians from Uganda where Idi Amin ordered the deportation of 80,000 Ugandans of Indian Descent from Uganda, adjudicating on what happened to their property left behind when Uganda's South Asian Minority was deported and Ugandan citizens of Indian ancestry voluntarily left due to increased Indophobia in Uganda. He also frequently travelled to Geneva, Switzerland and other cities to defend the Idi Amin regime to international bodies and foreign governments. Defection In March 1977, Lule was told over a lunch in Kampala that Idi Amin was planning on ousting and ultimately killing Lule, prompting Lule to leave the cafe where he was leaving and head directly to London, home of a vibrant expatriate Ugandan community of other prominent defectors from Idi Amin like former long-time Idi Amin Minister of Finance Emmanuel Blayo Wakhwweya two years earlier, without even returning to his house in Kampala. He kept a low profile in his first months in London, with news of his defection only being reported on 10 April 1977, and no mention was made in Uganda that he was missing and that he defected to the United Kingdom until July.

He also appealed for the United Kingdom, the United States, and European nations to boycott Idi Amin and his regime, calling a press conference with ex-Minister of Health Henry Kyemba where he urged the United Kingdom to stop allowing Idi Amin's \"whiskey runs\" where he would send cronies on flights to London's Stansted Airport to buy luxury goods for himself and supporters. He also worked for Hoskin and Company while in exile, working in Bournemouth and London. Return to Uganda and Private Practice In 1979, Idi Amin fled into exile moving to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia while Godfrey Serunkuma Lule returned from exile back to Uganda.

In order to avoid competition within, the contract between the two conglomerates clearly encased the territories of operation for both networks: StarPlus exclusively aired English programming, with Zee TV being its Hindi-language counterpart. However, on facing severe losses and very little market growth, Star violated the terms of the contract by slowly incorporating more and more Hindi programming into its schedule. Zee took Star to court over violation of the non-competing clause and shortly after that Star's partnership with Zee was dissolved on 30 June 2000. Consequently, Star TV split Star Plus' beam into two, in effect, providing two separate services for different regional audiences within Star TV's footprint. Star India took over the reins of the network in the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East, which enabled the channel to provide appropriate programming at accessible viewing time for audience across different regions of Asia. Subsequently, StarPlus was transformed into a Hindi-language general entertainment channel, with Star World becoming the network's English-language GEC. Initially, the channel followed a scheduling format similar to American networks, with new episodes of shows being aired on a weekly basis, a few days after their US telecast. This was altered in early-2010 to shows being aired on a daily basis Weekdays (Monday-Friday), to consolidate the channel's core viewership and appeal to the population of India. Thereafter, programming was classified into weekdays, weekends and late night slots, with new shows being brought in on a monthly basis throughout the year. The channel's high-definition feed was launched on 15 April 2011.

For defense, the unnamed enemy was limited to MiG-21 interceptors, and ground-launched missiles - either the SA-2s, which are launched from identified and fixed sites on the ground, or the SA-7s, which could be fired from portable launchers and can therefore appear anywhere. Compute! joked in 1989 that Falcon \"seemed harder to fly than the real plane\". That year Spectrum Holobyte released an update that reportedly made control and landings much easier. The Atari ST and Amiga versions of Falcon feature a semi-dynamic campaign where the player can roam the airspace, sweep for hostile aircraft, and attack ground targets. Destroyed buildings and SAM sites remain destroyed for fixed period of time, and hostile and friendly forces engage each other on the ground back and forth. Both of these versions have two expansion sets for them, Falcon Operation: Counterstrike and Falcon Operation: Firefight (released in Europe as Falcon Mission Disk Volume 2) in 1989-1990.

The district included two major universities, Texas A&M University in College Station and Baylor University in Waco. Before 2005, the district stretched from the Abilene area to the outer western fringes of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. History After the 2003 Texas redistricting, engineered by former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, TX-17 was (along with MS-4) the most heavily Republican district in the nation to be represented by a Democrat, according to the Cook Partisan Voting Index, which rated it R+20. The district was drawn to make it Republican-dominated and unseat its longtime incumbent, conservative Democrat Chet Edwards. While several of his colleagues were defeated by Republicans in 2004, Edwards held on to the seat in the 2004, 2006 and 2008 elections. But in the 2010 Congressional elections, the district elected Republican Bill Flores over Edwards by a margin of 61.8% to 36.6%. Flores was the first Republican to be elected to represent the district since its creation in 1919. Flores retired after five terms and former Texas 32nd district Congressman Pete Sessions, a Waco native, was elected in 2020. After passage of civil rights legislation and other changes, through the late 20th and early 21st centuries, white conservatives began to shift into the Republican Party in Texas They first supported presidential candidates, and gradually more Republicans for local, state and national office, resulting in the 2010 switch in party representation.

Football career Christou played for the Carlton Football Club and along with Anthony Koutoufides was a popular figure as a Greek Australian. In 2001, Christou had a solid pre-season, but missed the first month of the AFL season due to a knee injury. After his return in Round 7, Christou was noted for his penetrating kicks from defence. However, he was dropped after Round 17 playing only 13 games for the season, including a recall for the finals series of 2001 (receiving limited game time). Christou was noted for his long, accurate left foot kicks, often upwards of 60–65 metres. Whenever taking a kick, short or long, a chant from the Carlton crowd of \"WOOF!\" would always be heard. Christou was the second Carlton player to receive this chant, after Val Perovic (another long, left-footed defender) during the 1980s.

He is believed to have served as a model for the Little Chandler character in Joyce's short story collection Dubliners. Cousins was significantly influenced by Russell's ability to reconcile mysticism with a pragmatic approach to social reforms and by the teachings of Madame Blavatsky. He had a lifelong interest in the paranormal and acted as reporter in several experiments carried out by William Fletcher Barrett, Professor of physics at Trinity College Dublin and one of the founders of the Society for Psychical Research. Cousins worked as a teacher in The High School, Dublin. Cousins produced several books of poetry whilst in Ireland as well as acting in the first production of Cathleen Ní Houlihan (under the stage name of H. Sproule) with the famous Irish revolutionary and beauty Maud Gonne in the title role. His plays were produced in the first years of the twentieth century in the Abbey Theatre, the most famous being \"the Racing Lug\". After a dispute with W.B. Yeats, who objected to 'too much Cousins' the Irish National Theatre movement split with two-thirds of the actors and writers siding with Cousins against Yeats. He also wrote widely on the subject of Theosophy and in 1915 travelled to India with the voyage fees paid for by Annie Besant the President of the Theosophical Society. He spent most of the rest of his life in the sub-continent, apart from a year as Professor of English Literature at Keio University in Tokyo and another lecturing in New York. He formally converted to Hinduism in 1937. At the core of Cousins's engagement with Indian culture was a firm belief in the \"shared sensibilities between Celtic and Oriental peoples\". Whilst in India he became friendly with many key Indian personalities including the poet Rabindranath Tagore, the Indian classical dancer Rukmini Devi Arundale, the painter Abdur Rahman Chughtai and Mahatma Gandhi. He gave the William Miller Memorial Lectures at Madras in 1938 on \"The Idea, Expression, and Fulfillment of Beauty,\" and he was the person who brought change into the life of poetry of the Great Renowned Kannada Poet and Writer Kuvempu. He wrote a joint autobiography with his wife Margaret Elizabeth Cousins (formerly Gretta Gillespie), a suffragette and one of the co-founders of the Irish Women's Franchise League and All India Women's Conference (AIWC). In his The Future Poetry Sri Aurobindo has acclaimed Cousins' New Ways in English Literature as \"literary criticism which is of the first order, at once discerning and suggestive, criticism which forces us both to see and think.\" He has also acknowledged that he learnt to intuit deeper, being alerted by Cousins' criticisms of his poems. In 1920 Cousins came to Pondicherry to meet the Mother and Sri Aurobindo. The appreciation is palpable in the following citations: From The Future Poetry by Sri Aurobindo: \"It will be more fruitful to take the main substance of the matter for which the body of Mr.Cousins' criticism gives",

Taking the impression it creates for a starting-point and the trend of English poetry for our main text, but casting our view farther back into the past, we may try to sound what the future has to give us through the medium of the poetic mind and its power for creation and interpretation. The issues of recent activity are still doubtful and it would be rash to make any confident prediction; but there is one possibility which this book strongly suggests and which it is at least interesting and may be fruitful to search and consider. That possibility is the discovery of a closer approximation to what we might call the mantra in poetry that rhythmic speech which, as the Veda puts it, rises at once from the heart of the seer and from the distant home of the Truth, — the discovery of the word, the divine movement, the form of thought proper to the reality which, as Mr. Cousins excellently says, \" ''lies in the apprehension of a something stable behind the instability of word and deed, something that is reflection of the fundamental passion of humanity for something beyond itself, something that is a dim foreshadowing of the divine urge which is prompting all creation to unfold itself and to rise out of its limitations towards its Godlike possibilities. Poetry in the past has done that in moments of supreme elevation; in the future there seems to be some chance of its making it a more conscious aim and steadfast endeavour.\" Vegetarianism Cousins and wife Margaret were interested in anti-vivisection, theosophy, vegetarianism and women's suffrage. They were both strict vegetarians and in 1905 founded the Irish Vegetarian Society.

Deviations of a variable are measured from the mean of the data for that class – a son's weight minus the mean of all the sons' weights, or a father's weight minus the mean of all the fathers' weights. The Pearson correlation coefficient is the most commonly used measure of interclass correlation The interclass correlation contrasts with the intraclass correlation between variables of the same class, such as the weights of women and of their identical twins; here deviations are measured from the mean of all members of the single class, in this example of all women in the set of identical twins.

The company produced many microcomputers during the 1980s, mainly for French government agencies. This market collapsed at the end of the 1980s with the appearance of drastic budgetary restrictions in the French public sector and competition from more aggressive technological rivals like IBM, Apple and Olivetti. Despite a significant debt of 40 million francs, the company went public in 1985, claiming to hold 15% of the French microcomputer market. In January 1990, Goupil claimed to hold 18% of the market for professional microcomputers in France. The company filed for bankruptcy in June 1991 with the accounting books revealing a debt of 700 million francs and a real turnover of 830 million francs in 1990. Models The first Goupil G1 and G2 computers offered a promising architecture, with the integration of the Motorola 6808 processor coupled with the FLEX operating system. The machines had a sober and integrated design with particular colors - slate blue and red. The G3 extended compatibility in order to conquer foreign markets, by offering two processors at a time (selected at start-up by a switch) among three choices: the very common Motorola 6809, Zilog Z80 and Intel 8088. This allowed the Flex 9 and UniFLEX operating systems that came with the machine to run under MS-DOS, CP/M and UCSD Pascal. The dark gray case, designed by designer Roger Tallon, came with an integrated 12-inch monochrome monitor, two floppy disk drives, and a bay for 7 extension cards in Goupil format.

The line begins from Kotri Junction and ends at Attock City Junction. The total length of this railway line is . There are 94 railway stations from Kotri Junction to Attock City Junction on this line. History The present-day Kotri–Attock Railway Line was built as a patchwork of different railways during the 19th and 20th centuries by North Western State Railway and Pakistan Railways. The present day line consists of the following historic lines: Mari–Attock Railway The Mari–Attock Railway opened in 1891 as a broad gauge railway line between Mari Indus and Attock. In 1895 it was extended to Mianwali. Jacobabad–Kashmor Railway The Jacobabad–Kashmor Railway (also known as the Upper Sind Light Railway) opened in 1914 as a narrow gauge railway line between Jacobabad and Kashmore. Larkana–Jacobabad Light Railway The Larkana–Jacobabad Light Railway (also known as the Sind Light Railway) opened in 1924 as a narrow gauge railway line between Larkana and Jacobabad. In 1956, Pakistan Western Railway converted the all 3 sections from narrow gauge to broad gauge. Between 1969 and 1973, Pakistan Western Railways completed the gap section between Kashmore–Mari Indus and the line was also extended from Larkana to Kotri, thus linking Kotri to Attock In 2010, this line was designated Main Line 2 by Pakistan Railways to provide an alternative North–South route to the heavily used Karachi–Peshawar Railway Line.

It was first described in 2012 on the basis of systematic DNA barcoding of specimens from the genus Brunfelsia. Specimens belonging to the new species had previously been placed in the polymorphic species B. uniflora, which a molecular phylogeny revealed as polyphyletic. Etymology The species was named in honor of the American botanist Timothy Plowman (1944-1989) who had worked on neotropical plants of ethnobotanic importance and provided the first and only comprehensive taxonomic treatments of the genus Brunfelsia. Molecular diagnosis The new species differs from all other species of Brunfelsia at several nucleotide positions in the plastid ndhF gene and in the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region. Description The shrubs or small trees mostly have a single stem of up to 14 cm in diameter at the base, and they branch only above the base, typically 1–4 m and sometimes up to 10 m high. The bark is peeling or flaking, light gray or yellow-brown. Branches with the new twigs are densely covered with up to 0.3 mm long hairs, whereas the older branches exhibit a smooth and glabrous bark. Internodes range from 4–12 mm. The shiny and dark green leaves are scattered along the branchlets and often also covered with hairs, especially on younger twigs. They vary in size and shape, but are usually widest above the middle with a rather abruptly narrowed apex, similar to many Myrtaceae. The raised and somewhat cartilaginous ring of the corolla throat is reminiscent of that of species of Prestonia (Apocynaceae) from the same geographic region; it probably reflects adaptation to pollinator foraging behaviour. Nothing is known directly of the pollinators, but the floral features described above are shared by other South American brunfelsias for which butterfly pollination has been observed. The stomata are paracytic. The flower is solitary, terminal and often nodding, fragrant during the day. Both sepals and petals are partially fused and the latter colored violet, though the color fades to white with age, as is common in the South American species of Brunfelsia. The four stamens are adnate to the corolla, and the ovary is bicarpellate and syncarpous. The fruit is obovoid, coriaceous and capsular and reaches about 1 cm in diameter. It is probably green, and perhaps turning dark purple or black when ripe. There are ca. 9 ovoid seeds of about 6 mm in length. There are no observations on fully mature fruits or dispersal of the seeds. Herbarium specimens with ripe or nearly ripe fruits always show them splitting neatly from the top about 1/3 of the way to the base into two equal valves. Distribution Brunfelsia plowmaniana is known from humid forests in the Provinces of Salta and Jujuy in northwestern Argentina, and the Departments of Santa Cruz, Cochabamba and La Paz (Inquisivi Province) in",

It has never been collected in the neighbouring Provinces of Sud Yungas, Nor Yungas and Larecaja in the relatively well-explored central and northern parts of the Department of La Paz. Habitat Brunfelsia plowmaniana lives exclusively in Andean humid or cloud forests and shares its habitat with tree ferns like Dicksonia sellowiana as well as with members of the Podocarpaceae, Betulaceae, Cunoniaceae, Myrtaceae, Clethraceae and Caprifoliaceae families and numerous other Solanaceae. About one in three specimens of Brunfelsia plowmaniana is closely associated with epiphytic lichens, mosses and liverworts, reflecting the cloud forest habitat. Conservation status The species is often found in heavily grazed lower edges of the cloud forest where grazing, deforestation and fires are a threat to local populations Even though the range is narrow, it is about 800 km long; and many populations are in undisturbed or protected areas.

It has an area of 6,897 km2. The city is divided by the Ji-Paraná River. The city economy is industry and dairy production. The city was also the first of Rondônia State to invest in high technology of data transmission, when it connected, through a wireless network, the City Hall. The municipality name comes from tupi, meaning \"great river of axes\", through the junction of yî (axe) e paranã (sea, great river). It is a reference to the great amount of rocks in the river looking like indigenous axes. The municipality is also known as the Heart of Rondônia, due to the central city location and the existence of a heart shaped island, located in the confluence of the Machado and Urupá River. Located in central Rondônia, the city attracted many settlers from the 1970s onward. As a result of corruption, lawlessness and a general lack of regulation, Ji-Paraná has been at the centre of Rondônia's extreme deforestation, which today extends up to the border with Bolivia. The area between Ji-Paraná and Porto Velho, the regional capital 373 km away, is now largely deforested.

Ittihad were originally given 3rd place as JS Kabylie did not play a penalty shootout, as they claim they won the tie on away goals. The Algerian club also said that Ittihad had an unfair advantage playing at home in a one-off match. As a result, UNAF met on January 19 to discuss the case The UNAF later decided that the two clubs would share 3rd place, and therefore share the $75,000 prize fund.

It is bordered by the City of Coleraine to the west and north, City of Bovey on the north, an unorganized township on the east, and Blackberry Township to the south. Town government was adopted on March 6, 1894. The population was 1,056 at the 2020 census. Geography In 1870, Trout Lake Township, or 55 N Range 24 W of the 4th PM (principal meridian), was surveyed as part of the Public Land Survey System. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 34.7 square miles (89.8 km), of which 30.5 square miles (79.1 km) is land and 4.1 square miles (10.7 km), or 11.91%, is water. The Swan River and several lakes are within the township of which Trout Lake is the largest at 1862.08 acres with a maximum depth of 135 feet. The land sits in the Laurentian Mixed Forest Province, defined by a mixture of deciduous and coniferous forests. It is on top of the western portion of the Mesabi Iron Range. Natural resources Timber Logging in Trout Lake Township corresponds with the exhibits and re-enactments at the Minnesota Forest History Center, a site just 10 miles distant. The 1890s to 1910 was the \"golden era\" of lumbering in Minnesota. According to local interviews archived at the Iron Range Research Center, there were logging camps in the township. Settlers worked to provide railroad ties. Today, private landowners are encouraged to manage the forest through organizations such as the Minnesota Forestry Association,",

Itasca County, certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, manages tax forfeited public properties in Trout Lake Township for timber; cover type aspen-birch. Iron ore Iron ore was processed into taconite at the Trout Lake Washing and Concentrator Plant, 1907-1970. The plant, and the adjacent Trout Lake, provided it with a convenient location to deposit its tailings, which were pumped into the lake for nearly three decades. The Oliver Iron Mining Company's concentrator plant, its power station on the lake, and the workers' Bugaloosa location, are now gone. The history continues to qualify Trout Lake Township for Taconite Assistance and Tax Relief, and for benefits from the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board. Water The natural water system is in the Prairie-Willow Subbasin, of the Mississippi Headwaters Basin, within the Upper Mississippi Region. It is in Supervisor District 4 of the Itasca County Soil and Water Conservation District. Besides several creeks and Swan River, there are seven protected lakes. Each has a distinguishing number in the state’s identification system. The lakes are: #310206 Mud at 69.67 acres with a maximum depth of 5 feet #310207 Bass at 100 acres with 16 feet maximum #310208 Sampson at 17.24 acres (depth unknown) #310209 Round at 100.61 acres with 16 feet maximum #310210 Blackberry at 254 acres with 20 feet maximum #310214 Clearwater at 131.59 acres with 16 feet maximum #310216 Trout at 1862.08 with 135 feet maximum Bass, Clearwater, and Round lakes are classified by Itasca County as \"phosphorus sensitive lakes\". Blackberry and Mud lakes are on the state's inventory for wild rice. Trout lake has not had trout species since the 1940s. It is classified as a Cisco Refuge Lake because it has deep, cold water. The state maintains a boat landing on the southeast end of Trout Lake. It adjoins a campground that was previously a public park. Historically, the park was for company picnics of the Oliver Mining Company. It transferred to Greenway Lions Club and developed into Kom-On-In Beach and Recreation Area with the aid of Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board. After approximately half a century, the property was sold and is now Trout Lake RV Park and Campground. Wildlife Fishing, hunting and trapping are regulated by federal and state laws, managed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR), and enforced by MN DNR conservation officers and Itasca County Sheriff's Department. Alder Pond Ruffed Grouse Management Area and recreation trail system are on 190 acres located between town sections 29 and 32.

The 2020 US Census found the population at 1056 in 491 households. 5.4% were below the poverty level in 2020 compared to 11.5% the year before the US 2010 census. The residents of Trout Lake Township are 98.6% white. When the United States 2010 census was taken, none had been born outside of the country, and 80% had been born in Minnesota. 20.6% of the people within the marrying age (ages 15 and over) had never been married. 25.2% of residents ages 25 and over had some college or an associate's degree. Town government The settlers in the geographic township of Trout Lake, on March 6, 1894, organized themselves into a political township. The township became a public corporation, according to Minn. Stat. § 365.02, with governing authority granted by the state legislature. The first supervisors were N. Washburn, C.S. Brock, and August Keihta; clerk F.H. Webster; and treasurer, Robert Smith. Their first priority was building roads. With town government, residents decide at the annual town meeting, held on the second Tuesday of March, what the town levy will be, and to approve actions to be taken by the town board. The residents may also call special town meetings to address concerns. The Trout Lake town board meets at least monthly to oversee over 20 miles of township roads, two cemeteries, and a community center on ten acres with a playground, pavilion, and ball field. The town supervisors also represent the community on county committees, and joint powers associations. Trout Lake is also a voting precinct and administers a polling place at the Trout Lake Community Center. Basic rural services 9-1-1 emergency calls are directed to the appropriate agency for help. Trout Lake Township is patrolled by Itasca County Sheriff's Department. The town contracts with both Trout Lake Fire Department and Grand Rapids Fire Department. The majority of rural mail delivery is provided by the US Post Office in Bovey, and a southern portion, by the US Post Office in Grand Rapids; hence mailing addresses are zip codes 55709 or 55744 respectively. The community is connected by a network of county and township roads. The main thoroughfares are Trout Lake Road (#21), County Road 10, and County Road 71. The rural community of Trout Lake supports the economic and social infrastructure of its surrounding cities. There are not any active schoolhouses, churches, stores, or industries in the township. The township is within these service areas for amenities: Electricity from Lake Country Power, a Touchstone Energy Cooperative that purchases electricity from Great River Energy. Broadband from Paul Bunyan Communications, a telecommunication cooperative, that offers optic fiber internet connection to every house. Public transportation from Arrowhead Transit. Public education from Greenway School System #316, Grand Rapids School System #318, Itasca Area Community Education, and the Arrowhead Public Library System.

The route overlaps with other A-roads for several sections of its length. It is a faster route from Teignmouth to Salcombe than the A379 which meets it at both ends. It is under the control of Devon County Council as highway authority. Route The A381 starts in Teignmouth from a junction with the A379 at Shaldon Bridge, following the Teign Estuary to Kingsteignton, where it overlaps the A380 to cross the River Teign. At the Penn Inn Roundabout it then continues west on a short dual carriageway into central Newton Abbot and southwest to Totnes.

As the road approaches Kingsbridge it enters the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and skirts around the edge of the town, overlapping for a short distance with the A379 road before finally turning south to Salcombe. An identically-numbered spur from this road turns back eastward to Kingsbridge. History The constant pressure of traffic through the narrow streets of Totnes town centre prompted the construction of the Western Bypass around the edge of the town, together with a second crossing of the River Dart at Brutus Bridge in 1982. The tight-knit nature of the town centre's development, quickly thinning to countryside, meant that relatively few buildings needed demolition to facilitate construction of the new road. In 1991 and 2006 the route through and around Kingsbridge was redrawn twice, when the section northwest of Kingsbridge was downgraded to B-road status leaving a gap in the route, and subsequently diverted to the former route of the B3197 around the west side of the town leaving the original section through West Alvington as a spur of the new road. As a rural main road, the A381 has been the scene of multiple accidents. During 2008-2010 there were three fatal accidents on the section from Totnes to Halwell, prompting Devon County Council to implement a Casualty Severity Reduction Scheme, improving road markings and signage. On Sunday 20 May 2012 a section of the road through Totnes was part of the Olympic Torch procession for the London 2012 Olympics.

The platforms are roofed to protect passengers against sun, wind and rain. Railway stations for passenger trains always have a station building directly attached to the back of the principal platform. Consequently, all railway stations with a single platform have space for only one platform line and do not allow the presence of more than one train at the platform at the same time. In contrast, railway stations with two platforms have the space for two or three platform lines. All platforms are around 330 meters long. The station buildings are used for ticketing and for refreshments and contain waiting rooms and even rooms for prayers. They have media available (at least electricity, water). The outer appearance of station buildings of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway shows some sort of architectural eclecticism including Ethiopian elements with some Chinese interpretation and rounded elements. The railway station buildings on the Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway are rather functional and rectangular.

In a racing career which lasted from July 2001 until October 2002 she won four of her eight starts and was one of the best fillies of her generation in Europe at both two and three years of age. As a juvenile she was undefeated in three starts, following up a win in a maiden race with victories in the Group Three Prestige Stakes and the Group One Fillies' Mile. Despite fears that her diminutive stature made her unlikely to improve as a three-year-old, and a defeat when favourite the 1000 Guineas she recovered to record an emphatic success in the Irish 1,000 Guineas. The best of her three subsequent appearances came when she finished third to the colt Rock of Gibraltar in the Prix du Moulin. Since her retirement from racing she has become a successful broodmare. Background Gossamer is a small bay mare with a white star and a white sock on her right hind foot bred by Gerald Leigh who operated a small but successful breeding operation at his Eydon Hall Farm in Northamptonshire. She was one of the fourteenth crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. Her dam Brocade was a top-class racemare whose wins included the Prix de la Forêt. As a broodmare, Brocade also produced Gossamer's full brother Barathea and the Summer Stakes winner Free at Last. The filly was sent into training with Luca Cumani at Newmarket, Suffolk and was ridden in all of her races by Jamie Spencer. She was an unusually small Thoroughbred: horse blankets designed for standard-sized horses trailed below her knees and some commentators described her as \"pony-sized\" and doubted that she would ever make a top-class racehorse. Racing career 2001: two-year-old season During the 2001 season, Gerald Leigh, who was suffering from cancer, donated all of the prize money won by his horses to the charity Cancerbacup. On her racecourse debut, Gossamer was one of eleven fillies to contest a six-furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse on 12 July. Starting at odds of 12/1, she started slowly but took the lead inside the final furlong and won by a length from Karamah with the favoured Ya Hajar three lengths away in third place. On 26 August, the filly was stepped up in class for the Group Three Prestige Stakes over seven furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse and started 5/4 favourite against five opponents, headed by the John Dunlop-trained Kootenay.

Gossamer was moved up in class and distance for her final start of the year, the Group One Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse on 29 September. She started 4/6 favourite ahead of the May Hill Stakes winner Half Glance, whilst the other five runners included the Irish challenger Maryinsky, the Ed Dunlop-trained Fraulein and the highly regarded maiden winner Esloob. Gossamer raced behind the leaders as Esloob set the pace, before being switched to the outside in the straight. She took the lead approaching the final furlong and stayed on to win by two and a half lengths from Maryinsky, with Esloob a length and a quarter back in third place. After the race, the filly was made 2/1 ante-post favourite for the following year's 1000 Guineas. Cumani commented, \"I've won this race twice before, but I can say I haven't had a filly as exciting as this in 25 years' training.\" 2002: three-year-old season For her first appearance of the 2002 season, Gossamer was sent directly to contest the 189th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket on 5 May, after Cumani opted not to run in any of the recognised trial races. Commenting on his decision the trainer said that \"[Gossamer] is easy to get fit. And you are not really conceding an advantage by going straight there... It's more or less a level playing field.\" She started the 11/8 favourite but started slowly, struggled to obtain a clear run and stumbled approaching the final furlong before finishing eighth of the seventeen runners behind Kazzia. Three weeks later Gossamer was sent to Ireland for the Irish 1000 Guineas on heavy ground at the Curragh and was made the 4/1 favourite ahead of Alasha and Quarter Moon, both of whom had finished ahead of her at Newmarket. The rest of the fifteen runner field included Zenda (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches), Rum Charger (Athasi Stakes), Saranac Lake (Debutante Stakes), Red Rioja (C L Weld Park Stakes) and Marionnuad (Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes). Spencer tracked the leaders as the outsider Alstermeria made the running before moving the filly up to dispute the lead with Starbourne a furlong from the finish. In the closing stages Gossamer drew away from the field and won by four and a half lengths from Quarter Moon with Starbourne and Alstemeria in third and fourth. After the race Spencer said \"I was never worried from the moment I hit the gate\", and added \"this filly is special. If I get a wife like her, I'll be happy!\". Cumani commented \"She has no quirks, a wonderful temperament, and is a perfect racing machine. I am glad she has silenced the doubters and there will be improvement to come\".

Education Goldstein attended public school in Miami Beach, Florida and graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School in 1966. He received his B.A. with Honors from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1970 where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and the Order of the Golden Fleece. He received a M.Ed. from the University of Massachusetts in 1973 and a J.D. with Honors from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1976, where he served on the editorial board of the North Carolina Law Review. Goldstein never enrolled in a business course during his undergraduate or graduate career. The first time he attended a formal business class was when he spoke to a marketing class at the UNC Kenan–Flagler Business School about his success as an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurship Buck Goldstein has been involved in entrepreneurship most of his professional life. After four years of working at a corporate law firm, he co-founded Information America, an online information company that was the first to make courthouse information available from remote terminals in lawyer’s offices. The business began as a two-person start-up and grew to over $40,000,000 in revenues, eventually going public and trading on the NASDAQ. Customers included virtually every major law firm in the United States, most of the Fortune 500 and many large federal agencies including the FBI, the DEA and the CIA. In 1994, Information America was acquired by West Publishing, the largest legal publisher in the world and soon after was acquired by Thomson Corporation, a multi-national information publishing company. He later founded NetWorth Partners, a venture capital fund focusing on information based enterprises with Mellon Ventures as its largest investor and subsequently became a partner in Mellon Ventures, a subsidiary of Mellon Bank. As a partner, Goldstein invested in a number of emerging businesses and served on the Board of Directors of over 15 companies. More recently, Goldstein served as Chairman of MedFusion, a Raleigh-based medical information technology company acquired by Intuit in 2010, and as Board Observer and advisor for iContact, an email marketing company based in the Research Triangle Park acquired by Vocus in 2012. Additionally, Goldstein has served as an advisor to Liquidia, a nano-technology company founded in the UNC chemistry department, and as a board member of Nourish International, a non-profit organization that engages college students across the United States in on campus social businesses and international poverty reduction projects. Over the years, Goldstein has served on boards in a variety of capacities, including chairman of the Institute of Arts and Humanities advisory board at UNC-Chapel Hill, president of the Atlanta Chapter of the American Jewish Committee, and board member of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta.

Paralyzed by it, he's immobile and the suspect escapes. Tsuneo recovers, completely perplexed. To his bosses he explains that the suspect tripped him and ran away. That same night, on the verge of sleep, he is again flooded by a huge wave of paralyzing emotion, this time sadness. As it passes, he hears a female voice saying \"Who are you?\" in the darkness, which then disappears. Over the next days, Tsuneo starts to hear this voice more, and eventually it responds to him and he begins a dialogue with it. It claims to be the voice of a woman, very lonely, and that with all her energy she somehow \"projected\" herself into the world, and Tsuneo was the one to answer. Initially Tsuneo thinks it is the voice of \"Eric\", someone he knew whilst living in America, but in time accepts that this is not so. Tsuneo becomes increasingly fascinated by the voice and their dialogues, and wonders whether he is suffering from auditory hallucinations. Because of his erratic behavior, he is given time off work and must see a doctor. His arranged marriage is also called off for similar reasons. As the voice continues to speak to him, he asks that he may tell her his story, which has been hinted at throughout. Tsuneo tells the voice how, after his permit runs out in America, he narrow escapes being caught by immigration officials, and one day meets Eric in a city square. Forty-something Eric seems to take pity on Tsuneo, and offers him a job in his shop selling light fittings, and lodgings. However, on one particular night in Eric's care, Tsuneo is approached by the man who then exposes him to physical affection. As time goes by Eric makes multiple more passes at Tsuneo who, definitely opposed but unsure of how to rebuff or break away from Eric (who had been so kind in the beginning) passively submits to Eric's wishes. Tsuneo desperately wishes to escape the relationship, but can see no way out since he has no car and would get arrested by the immigration officials if he ran away (he also suspects Eric knows these facts and is taking advantages of them). Sometime later, he attempts to escape under the guise of \"taking a short break to the sea\", but Eric questions why he is taking his passport, and is forced to leave it behind. Instead, while on his trip Tsuneo makes a hoax call to the police, claiming that Eric is in possession of and dealing a large amount of drugs. Tsuneo hopes that while Eric is detained and questioned, he will have a window to escape the country and get back to Japan. However, when the police try to take Eric in there is an accident and Eric is killed. A while after Tsuneo has related his story to the voice, he asks if the woman behind the voice will meet",

If at that time he still wishes to meet her, despite her claim she is unimaginably ugly, then she will concede. Six months pass, during which Tsuneo still has bouts of intense and irrational emotion, sadness and happiness reminiscent of bipolar disorder. When the voice contacts him again, he does still wish to meet, and a time is set at which to meet her outside a museum. When Tsuneo goes to the museum at the appointed time, the voice directs him towards a tree, behind which a blind girl of about eighteen stands. When she speaks, \"Hello Mr Kasama\", Tsuneo knows he has been misled again, and expresses his anger towards the voice. It tells him that in future whenever he thinks of her he must remember her in the form of this girl.

O'Brien reached a settlement with NBC that barred him from appearing on television until September 2010, but it did not bar him from performing before a live audience in a concert setting.

Even with the unconventional marketing campaign of a single Twitter announcement, many locations sold out within hours of the tweet and additional shows were added on to meet demand. During the tour, O'Brien announced that his new show, Conan, would debut on TBS in November 2010. A documentary following O'Brien during the tour, Conan O'Brien Can't Stop, was released in June 2011. Background and announcement In January 2010, late-night talk show hosts Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno engaged in a public relations conflict over who should host The Tonight Show. Due to low ratings for The Jay Leno Show and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien, NBC announced a schedule change, moving Leno from 10:00 pm to 11:30 pm, and O'Brien from 11:30 pm to 12:00 am. This change resulted in a public outcry and public demonstrations largely in support of O'Brien. O'Brien indicated that he would quit his show and leave the network if NBC were to implement it, citing the \"destruction\" of the venerable franchise which had aired at or around 11:30 pm for over 60 years. As part of the deal between O'Brien and NBC, O'Brien was legally prohibited from appearing on television prior to September 1, 2010. He began to utilize social media to remain engaged with his fan base. O'Brien started a Twitter account on February 24, 2010. After about one hour, O'Brien's subscriber list had reached over 30,000 members and, approximately 30 minutes later, he was on the brink of passing 50,000 followers. After 24 hours, O'Brien had well over 300,000 followers. In late May 2010, he surpassed the one million mark for number of Twitter followers. O'Brien announced via his Twitter account that he would embark on a 30-city live tour on March 11, 2010, beginning on April 12, 2010. On the same day, teamcoco.com, an official website, was launched. According to TMZ, O'Brien decided not to keep any of the proceeds from the tour, in order to employ his show's staff members. Format Several members of O'Brien's staff joined him for the tour, including sidekick Andy Richter, and the former Tonight Show Band, temporarily renamed \"The Legally Prohibited Band\". Max Weinberg, the band leader, was unable to participate in the tour due to his recent heart surgery, although he did appear at one of the New York City shows. Signs at each venue encouraged audience members using Twitter during the show to use a unique hashtag. Reggie Watts served as the tour's opening act. In the video introduction to the show, Conan appeared as an obese and bearded version of himself struggling to cope with the loss of his talk show while Eric Carmen's \"All By Myself\" plays.

Such a department is present in many parliamentary democracies. The department is roughly equivalent in function to a president's office in a presidential system of government or an office of the council of ministers in a semi-presidential system. Typology In many countries, such a department is called a Prime Minister's Office. In some other countries, there is a Cabinet Office. In the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister's Office is a part of the Cabinet Office; in Australia and New Zealand, there is a single department called the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. In some countries, such as Germany and Poland, the department supporting the prime minister (the Chancellor in Germany) is called the chancellery Self-governing states and provinces within federations that are parliamentary democracies often have similar departments, such as a premier's department or, in Australia, Department of the Premier and Cabinet.

Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Dan López called The Great Believers \"a heartbreaking meditation on AIDS, loss, and friendship.\" Kirkus said the book was \"as compulsively readable as it is thoughtful and moving.\" NPR's Celia McGee noted, \"Makkai’s writing isn’t the kind that calls attention to itself, allowing the people, emotions, personal incidents and public occurrences of her book to take shape with the force of urgency and the authentic, the grievousness of deceit—by lovers, by families, by hope—and the generosity of romance, sorrow, growth and wonder. She unleashes a mathematics as compelling as her attention to the contradictions within personalities.\" Newsday's Tim Murphy wrote that Makkai \"has, in fact, done a superb job of capturing a group of friends in a particular time and place with humor and compassion. Conversations among her gay male characters feel very real — not too flamboyant, not too serious, always morbidly witty. It's hard not to get drawn into this circle of promising young men as they face their brutally premature extinction\" Kirkus named The Great Believers one of the best books of the year.

It is a Grade II listed building. History The building was commissioned to replace an aging mid-19th century vestry hall on St Matthews Row, which had been used by the Parish of St Matthew. The vestry hall had become the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green in 1900. After the vestry hall had become inadequate for the council's needs, civic leaders decided to procure a new town hall. The site selected for the new building had previously been occupied by residential properties known as 2-16 Patriot Square. The foundation stone for the new building was laid on 23 September 1909. The new building was designed by Percy Robinson and William Alban Jones in the Baroque style and built by Brand, Pettit and Co. It was officially opened on 1 November 1910. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with three bays facing onto Cambridge Heath Road; the central bay featured a doorway on the ground floor, a large arched recess on the first floor and a domed tower above. A large sculpture depicting Charity, designed by Henry Poole, was installed above the main doorway. The building extended back for nine bays along Patriot Square, with a smaller sculpture depicting Justice, also designed by Poole, installed in the middle of that elevation.

John MacLean, the Bolshevik Consul in Glasgow used the occasion to denounce the party leaders as being police spies, an accusation for which there was no evidence. According to MacLean, a private meeting was held at which William McLaine, one of the delegates of the BSP sent to the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern, was instructed to report to Lenin himself that MacLean was no longer reliable as he was suffering from \"hallucinations\". The building was substantially extended to the east further along Patriot Square, to the designs of E.C.P. Monson in the neoclassical style, with the works being completed in October 1939. The extension, which added an extra 21 bays to the Patriot Square elevation, featured a three-bay central section with a sculpture depicting the Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green above the doorway, three windows on each of the first and second floors and a pediment above. Internally, the principal rooms were the new council chamber, which was richly panelled with Australian walnut, and the mayor's room, both on the first floor. Consideration was given to incorporating a public hall into the design for the extension but council leaders decided to adapt York Hall, which had originally been planned as public baths, to accommodate a wider variety of uses instead. The building continued to function as the local seat of government for the enlarged London Borough of Tower Hamlets when it was formed in 1965. After the council moved to more modern facilities at Mulberry Place in 1993, the building lay vacant although the panelled council chamber was used as a location for several films including Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, released in 1998, and Atonement, released in 2007.

The Coast, a weekly newspaper, has called it \"downtown's biggest gaping hole\" and an \"embarrassing missing tooth\" in the urban fabric. Much of the site was once home to the Texpark, a city-owned parking garage, demolished in 2004. The lot was sold to United Gulf Developments, who have formally put forward three development proposals for the site. Two of the proposals were approved by the city, but as of 2020 no construction has ever taken place. Definition The site is bounded by Granville Street, Sackville Street, and Hollis Street – to the west, north, and east respectively – and by the MetroPark facility to the south. The demolished Tex-Park garage actually only occupied the northern half of what is commonly termed the \"Texpark site\". The southern half is mainly vacant, but also houses a five-storey office building at 1568 Hollis Street, built in 1960, which still has commercial tenants and is also owned by United Gulf Developments. Ownership of the Texpark site was transferred to 3104854 Nova Scotia Ltd., a numbered company controlled by United Gulf. Background The lot was once home to the Texpark, a six-storey municipal parking structure built in the early 1960s. It was proposed by the Downtown Business and Professional Men's Association in 1960, at a time when the city was expanding outward in a car-oriented manner and the downtown was in decline. The view of the association was that a multi-storey parking structure would revitalise the downtown area. It hired an architect to draw up preliminary plans for a garage and selected the site themselves, which was occupied by smaller, older structures housing residences and businesses. The business association urged city council to expropriate these inhabitants. The request was well received by the Committee on Works and the planning director. Council agreed to proceed with a scaled-down version of the proposal and expropriated eight properties from private owners in order to clear the land. Displaced residents received priority upon application to the Housing Authority, and many were resettled at Mulgrave Park,",

The garage was leased out to Texaco Canada on a long-term basis and had a service station on the ground floor as well as a convenience store. The lease was reassigned to Ultramar when that company purchased assets of Texaco Canada in 1990. The garage was in decrepit condition by the turn of the millennium. The city issued a request for proposals for a new downtown parking garage on 6 September 2000, intended to replace the parking spaces at both the Texpark and the Bishop's Landing sites. It received five valid submissions and a proposal by the Hardman Group was approved by Regional Council on 12 December 2000. Construction of the replacement garage, which sits at the opposite end of the same city block as the Texpark site, began in April 2001. Called MetroPark, it opened on 1 April 2002. The Texpark was demolished in late 2004 by the city. The vacant lot was sold to United Gulf Developments the same year. Development proposals Tender proposal When United Gulf originally bid for the site on 30 April 2004, they proposed a single 26-storey tower with retail space on the ground floor and an unspecified arrangement of hotel and residential space above. However, this was not proposed under a formal development approvals process. The sale would be for a vacant lot on an as-is basis, with no development permit guarantees – meaning the winning bidder would still need to acquire a Development Agreement for any development over 40 feet tall. The height cap for as-of-right development on the site was later revised to 24 storeys under the HRM by Design form-based code. Twisted Sisters United Gulf submitted a formal development application in 2005. Widely termed the Twisted Sisters in local media for its twisting form, the proposal comprised two 27-storey towers (including the height of the common podium) designed by Hariri Pontarini Architects of Toronto. The estimated cost was approximately $150 million. The two towers would house a hotel and condo residences respectively, while the podium would house retail space. Like other high-rise proposals in Halifax, the towers were controversial among some who believed they would partially obstruct the view of the Halifax Harbour from Citadel Hill. City planning staff noted that the towers would not be visible from inside the Citadel's historic parade square due to the steep slope of the downtown area. During the multi-day public hearing on the project, heritage groups expressed opposition to the scheme on these grounds. Howard Epstein, then-MLA for Halifax Chebucto, stated: \"We have already been blessed with icons [...] The things that make Halifax recognizable, geology has given us. We don't need anything replacing the Citadel as our iconic focus.\" On the other hand, many young people spoke in favour of the development, calling it a sign of progress and a bright economic future in Halifax. The development was approved by regional council on 7 February 2006. Heritage groups (namely the Heritage Trust of Nova Scotia, the Federation",

The NSUARB stated that the proposal did not violate the Municipal Planning Strategy and did not impinge on the statutory viewplanes that protect the views from Citadel Hill. Despite finally gaining approval, United Gulf never proceeded with the Twisted Sisters proposal and the Development Agreement expired in 2010. In June 2011, regional council discussed discharging the Development Agreement, but United Gulf objected due to a misunderstanding over the expiry date and stated that they were preparing a new proposal for the site. Skye Halifax (2012) In 2012, United Gulf proposed a twin tower development for the site called Skye Halifax, the largest and tallest development ever proposed in the city. The proposal comprised two 44-storey towers, atop a four-storey shared podium, designed by Toronto architect Peter Clewes. The complex would house hotel rooms, condos, retail, and dining space and aimed for LEED certification. The estimated cost of construction was $350 million. The proposal was opposed by the city planning department, the Design Review Committee, former chief urban designer Andy Fillmore, and the Downtown Halifax Business Commission. Mayor Savage stated in council that approving the proposal would undermine council's commitment to HRM by Design, an urban design and development approvals framework, because Skye Halifax greatly exceeded the specified height limit for as-of-right development. On 20 November 2012 the council voted against allowing the proposal to proceed. In 2013 Navid Saberi, president of United Gulf, said that he would likely make another proposal to City Hall within the following year to 18 months. However, he did not. The 2006 Twisted Sisters Development Agreement, after expiring in 2010, was left in an \"inactive\" state. Council had to vote to either expunge or extend it. United Gulf president Navid Saberi stated in May 2016 that his company was \"very close\" to submitting a new proposal and hoped council would agree to an extension. In a letter dated 5 May 2016, an architecture firm representing United Gulf requested an extension to the Development Agreement's date of commencement. City staff recommended against this action and further recommended discharging the Development Agreement. Council voted on 20 September 2016 to discharge the Development Agreement. Skye Halifax (2019) United Gulf put forward a new proposal in 2019, also called Skye Halifax. It comprises two 21-storey, 66-metre-tall towers linked by a shared podium. The development would include 25,000 square feet of retail space, 400 residential units, 100 hotel rooms, and indoor car parking. Like the previous proposal, the design was produced by Peter Clewes of architecture firm architectsAlliance. The city's Design Review Committee approved the proposal with conditions in November 2019 At that time, Saberi claimed he planned to begin construction in January 2021.

Cal served in the marines during World War II, fighting on Saipan during the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. Even in the midst of the war, Marvin was enamored with hockey and wanted his small hometown to have a rink of its own; he named the Warroad Arena Fund as the beneficiary of his $10,000 life insurance policy (roughly $145,000 in 2020). After returning from the war, Marvin and Dick Roberts held several fundraisers for the community and by 1947 had raised enough money to build the city's first ice rink. Before the rink had been built, however, Cal had put together the first Lakers team in 1946 to compete against other senior teams in north-western Minnesota.

Marvin began playing for the team in his sophomore season and also served as an assistant coach for Don Norman. Because college games were usually only played on Friday or Saturday, Marvin and many of his Fighting Sioux teammates were able to concurrently play for both UND and the Warroad Lakers. Cal retired as a player after the 1951 season but remained as the Lakers' head coach for most of the next 45 years, leading the team to the 1955 United States Intermediate title, and the Canadian Intermediate Championship in both 1964 and 1974. He took a short leave to coach the US National Team at the 1958 Ice Hockey World Championships, finishing fifth out of eight. With all of his accomplishments, it was the players that he coached that proved to be Marvin's greatest legacy. Over a dozen Lakers alumni played for the US National Team including Bill and Roger Christian, who won gold medals at the 1960 Winter Olympics. Several players also reached the NHL like Henry Boucha, Clarence Schmidt and Dave Christian (Bill's son). Towards the end of the Lakers' existence, then being coached by Marvin's son David, the team produced an incredible run by winning three consecutive Allan Cups (1994-1996) and narrowly missing out on a fourth in 1997; no other team has won more than two in a row. Warroad was also one of only two American teams to win the Cup (the other being the Spokane Jets\\Flyers). The Lakers suspended operating after 1997 when they couldn't find a league to play in but returned for a brief time in 2001 as the 'Islanders'.

In heavily congested traffic, natural breaks occur rarely, thus the term traffic break most commonly refers to the manual separation of traffic, normally conducted by highway patrol officers. Most such traffic breaks are used to clear a hazardous obstruction from the road or to allow a stalled vehicle to safely make its way off the road and onto the shoulder. For example, a highway patrol officer may arrive at the site of the accident and then radio to another officer to initiate a traffic break. The second officer enters traffic before the site of the accident, turns on their warning lights, and begins weaving across multiple lanes to signal that other drivers are to slow down and remain behind the officer. The speed to which the officer slows is based on the amount of time needed to clear the accident ahead. An officer may completely stop traffic to yield larger separation. The second officer then radios ahead to the first officer, who is still at the site of the accident, and gives them a description of the last vehicle traveling ahead at regular speeds. The first officer will use this information to determine when it is safe to move the accident off the road and onto the shoulder. Traffic breaks may also be conducted to gradually slow traffic in preparation for a large accident ahead that has caused traffic to stop abruptly. This greatly reduces the chance of subsequent crashes due to motorists not braking in time. Other traffic breaks may give time for construction activities to be completed uninterrupted. Some construction requires equipment that obstructs the flow of traffic to a point that it becomes a major hazard to have traffic trying to travel around them, such as adjusting the placement of a traffic sign, (re)striping lane markers, or sweeping the roadway. Alternatively, some construction would produce dangerous conditions to passing vehicles, such as blasting. In rare circumstances, civilian motorists have initiated traffic breaks. In 2004, one Alameda County man ran a traffic break to aid in the emergency landing of a small Cessna 172 on Interstate 580. When a single traffic break does not allow sufficient time to complete a task, multiple breaks may be conducted in series. This practice is called \"running a round-robin\". Rolling roadblock During times of high congestion, risky driving, or dangerous road conditions, law enforcement may institute so-called \"rolling roadblocks,\" where official vehicles line up across the road and drive at a set speed. Since anyone attempting to pass them would be doing so on the shoulder and thereby garnering a ticket from the officer, traffic speeds",

Biography Dandurand graduated from the Faculty of Law at Université Laval, and worked as a corporate lawyer in Quebec. Dandurand, a Montreal lawyer, was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1898 by Sir Wilfrid Laurier. He served as Speaker of the Senate of Canada from 1905 to 1909 and was either Leader of the Government in the Canadian Senate or Leader of the Opposition in the Canadian Senate from 1921 until 1942. As Government Leader in the Senate he served in every Cabinet formed by William Lyon Mackenzie King from 1921 until Dandurand's death in 1942. He also served as President of the League of Nations Assembly in 1925 and was Canada's delegate to the League's council from 1927 to 1930. He is perhaps best remembered for having said, in 1924, that in international affairs Canada was “a fireproof house, far from inflammable materials.” King relied heavily on Dandurand and Ernest Lapointe for advice on Quebec as well as on international affairs and it was Dandurand who suggested Louis St. Laurent for King's Cabinet after Lapointe's death. After his death, he was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal. Family In January 1886, Dandurand married Joséphine Marchand, daughter of Quebec premier and dramatist Hon Félix-Gabriel Marchand and his wife, Marie Herselie Turgeon. Josephine was born in Saint-Jean, Quebec, and was educated at the Convent of Les Dames de la Congregation de Notre Dame a branch of Villa-Maria. Her literary works included dramatic pieces, papers and essays on subjects of public interest and in relation to women's duties, rights and place. She founded and edited Le Coin du Feu, a women's paper. She was a member and office-bearer of the National Council of Women of Canada, in which she advanced practical schemes for the promotion of the industrial and fine arts in Canada and the establishment of a Department of Art.

It is also the name used for a bootleg recording of the first show. It is most notable for being the spark that would lead to Adrian Smith forming his ASAP project later on and ultimately his split with Iron Maiden in 1990 (He returned in 1999 and has since remained a member of the band, although he has pursued other projects). It is also notable for leading to the first Iron Maiden recording without the current lead singer on lead vocals. Background At the end of the World Slavery Tour in July 1985, Iron Maiden took six months off, when Nicko McBrain's frustration of not playing after winding down from an extensive Iron Maiden tour and looking at a six-month break, drove him to rent a rehearsal studio and invite Adrian Smith along to jam. The two invited more friends including: Dave Colwell (the one who wrote \"Reach Out\"), Visage guitarist Andy Barnett as well as Martin Connoly, a friend of McBrain's who also played in Marshall Fury. Colwell and Barnett were both members of an early line-up of the band FM at the time \"That Girl\" was written in 1984 by Barnett with bassist Merv Goldsworthy and drummer Pete Jupp. It was this early version of the song which was performed by The Entire Population of Hackney and later covered by Iron Maiden, whilst FM re-wrote parts of their song for inclusion on their 1986 debut album, Indiscreet. McBrain arranged two gigs, one under the name The Entire Population of Hackney and the other under the name The Sherman Tankers. The audience recording called The Entire Population of Hackney was taken from the first show; Bruce Dickinson, Dave Murray and Steve Harris joined the band on stage only for the encores. Their set includes songs from all the members and some covers from Bob Seger and ZZ Top. The result of this short break from Iron Maiden was that three of the songs featured in the setlist would be later used on two Iron Maiden singles. \"Reach Out\" featured on \"Wasted Years\" and \"Juanita\" and \"That Girl\" featured on \"Stranger in a Strange Land\".

His contribution was remembered and was the unanimous choice as a Hall of Fame awardee of the Golden Wheel Awards Foundation in Philippines.1. This award was presented to Ventura by Dante Silverio on March 3, 2012 held at Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino in the Cultural Center of the Philippines. Biography Ventura was born 1931 in Manila, Philippines. Born into a family of 12 siblings, he was the youngest of 4 brothers. Ventura's interest in racing began in 1956; He had been waiting for a traffic light to change and a car drove up alongside his. A definite speed challenge. The car belonged to Conrado \"Dodo\" Ayuyao, who later became one of his closest friends. Ayuyao knew a group of car enthusiasts that got together on Sundays. They tested their engine's performance by drag racing at Nielson Field in Makati. It was not all racing for Francisco, in 1958, he established his own business, Win-Dor Steel Mfg. Cam Wreckers Association Ventura regularly met with other speed aficionados including Dodjie Laurel, Bob Smith, Ruben Saulog, Joe Cacho, Jun Campillo, Eugene and Sam SyCip. Together with Ayuyao, this group formed the first official motor racing club in the Philippines, the Cam Wreckers Association. The Sunday racing group felt it was time to make their passion official. When trying to come up with a name, their mechanic kept interrupting and complaining that he needed more cam shafts because they were always breaking, hence, the start of the Cam Wreckers Club. The club's objective was to invite others to race cars, go karts, boats and to compete locally and internationally. Racing achievements 1961, Pasig, Philippines. Drag Jamboree Class B.

The lower portions of the walls were left standing after the fire since they were built with a stronger stone. Teishebaini is situated at a height of . History The city of Teishebaini was built by Rusa II in mid-7th century BC to protect the eastern borders of Urartu from the barbaric Cimmerians and Scythians. Within the city was a governors palace that contained a hundred and twenty rooms spreading across more than , and citadel named the Citadel of Teisheba after the Urartian god of war. The palace was made of stone, with timber ceilings, and timber columns that supported the roof. The construction of the city, palace, and the citadel were not fully finished until the reign of Rusa III, some 50 years later. Agriculture was essential to the city, as was raising livestock. The Urartians built massive water canals, some of which are still in use to this day. Archaeological excavations have shown that lentils, hemp, peas, sesame, wheat, and barley were some of the grains that were grown in the area, as well as grapes and plums. The grape seeds that had been found were examined further and it revealed that twelve varieties of grape were grown in the surrounding area of Teishebaini during this time. All of these ancient varieties and more are still grown to this day in modern Armenia. Smaller ceramic vessels were also found in excavations and are known to have been used in brewing beer made from barley. Other much larger vessels were used for storing foods and wine. Small circular markings on the sides of the containers near the top indicated the amount that could be stored inside. The vessels were usually buried half-way into the soil which naturally kept foods cool. The site was discovered in 1939 after being buried for more than two and a half millennia. A cuneiform inscription had been found three years earlier that led to the discovery of the ancient city. It read, 'Rusa Argishti-hini' which translates to \"Rusa, son of Argishti\" also known as Rusa II. Another set of cuneiform inscriptions were found written upon a bronze belt and bronze bolt, both bearing the words \"Rusa Argishti, fortress of the city of Teishebaini.\" The inscriptions helped date the site and tell who its builder was. In 1941 an ivory statuette of the god Teisheba was found within the citadel. The excavations here are considered one of the most important archaeological discoveries and findings in the Middle East, the Near East and Asia Minor. Some of the findings include carved ivory, stone, ceramics, metal figurines, pottery and an astonishing wide variety of bronze domestic tools and utensils, military equipment decorated with mythological symbols, forms and animals, daggers, swords, helmets, arrows, quivers, shields of an advanced metallurgy, as well",

Archaeological evidence shows that the city of Teishebaini was destroyed by fire sometime around the beginning of the 6th century BC. Numerous fragments of cloth, rope, and other items such as seeds have been found charred from the city's destruction. It is thought that Teishebaini was attacked during the night since numerous human remains have been found, and rooms within the buildings still had everything in them as if the people living within the city's walls had no chance to flee. During the excavations, skeletons were found holding objects of gold in their hands It is theorized that when the city was set on fire, that residents of the city began either to loot or save their own possessions from the burning buildings as the city was under attack.

This compound was created by reacting actinium(III) chloride with monosodium phosphate in aqueous hydrochloric acid. This resulted in the hemihydrate AcPO4·1/2H2O, whose structure was confirmed by x-ray diffraction to match that of lanthanum phosphate To become anhydrous, it was heated to 700 °C, which resulted in a solid that was black (presumably due to the presence of impurities), and whose specific X-ray structure did not match that of other known correspond to other actinide phosphates.

The film stars Vogel as a serial killer named Peter, who kidnaps and kills several innocent people, while his unnamed accomplice, played by Peters, films and documents the murders. Filmed in an intentionally amateurish found footage style, August Underground was met with mixed reviews. The film was followed by two sequels, August Underground's Mordum in 2003, and August Underground's Penance in 2007. Plot Peter, a serial killer, invites his camera-wielding friend into his basement, where he is holding a woman named Laura captive. Peter and his accomplice torture her at their leisure, committing sadistic acts such as slicing one of her nipples off and covering her in feces and urine. Next, the two pick up a female hitchhiker. After Peter coerces her into performing oral sex, he beats and leaves her for dead on the side of the road. After the duo are kicked out of a concert for rowdy behavior, Peter and his accomplice return to the house to find that Laura has died. Peter murders an old woman in her home, then terrorizes a convenience store with his accomplice. They abandon their plans to kidnap the clerk or a shopper when they hear police sirens approaching. The two then proceed to tour Roadside America, and visit a tattoo parlor. When the tattoo artist finishes giving Peter a tattoo, he and his twin brother are captured by Peter and the cameraman. They cut a leg off of the tattoo artist then bludgeon him and his brother to death. The two hire prostitutes for a drug-fueled orgy. Peter sodomizes one prostitute while beating her with a hammer. The remaining prostitute tries to escape. In the chaotic chase that ensues, the accomplice drops the camera, leading to silence in the room.

Initially, Vogel had wanted to make a \"big-budget zombie film\", but felt that his inexperience at making a feature film would turn away any potential financiers. With this in mind, Vogel decided to make another film that would help him gain awareness of his work and potential financing for the film. The idea for the film came from Vogel's frustration with the serial killer genre, which he felt \"didn't show you what was really going on\". Taking inspiration from John McNaughton's Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Vogel wanted to make a film that was both \"ugly\" and realistic while also being unique and original. Principal photography began in August 2000, under the working title Peter. Vogel initially hoped to conduct a guerrilla marketing campaign for the film, in which VHS tapes of the film would be placed in random locations around the United States, such as parks and playgrounds, for passersby to discover. However this plan was abandoned following the September 11 attacks and subsequent anthrax attacks. Release Critical response Gregory S. Burkart of Bloody Disgusting included August Underground on his list \"20 Landmarks of Found-Footage Horror!\", writing: \"I'm not a big fan of this series, but I admire Vogel's fearless audacity in serving up the ultimate in onscreen sadism\". Jay Alan from HorrorNews.net gave the film a positive review, praising the film's performances, gore effects, and realistic quality. Chris Mayo of Severed Cinema offered similar praise: \"August Underground is a true testament of what horror should be; nasty, nihilistic, raw and real\". Robert Firsching from Allmovie wrote in his review on the film: \"A grueling but important antidote to the plethora of films glamorizing serial killers, August Underground is not likely to find a wide audience, but will not leave those who manage to find a copy unaffected\". The film was later ranked at #14 in Complex's Most Disturbing Movies of All Time, with the entry on the film noting its realistic quality, and \"sadistically natural vibe\". Controversy In 2005, while traveling to Canada to attend the Rue Morgue Festival of Fear in Toronto, director and co-writer Fred Vogel was arrested, pending charges of transporting obscene materials into Canada, when copies of August Underground and its sequel were found by customs officials among the merchandise he had intended to bring to the convention The charges were eventually dropped, after Vogel had spent roughly ten hours in customs custody, and his films were sent to Ottawa for further observation.

She was a frequent contributor to The Churchman and other publications of the Protestant Episcopal church. She was the author of novels and religious works, including Toiling and Hoping (New York, 1856); The Boy Missionary (1859); Losing the Way (1860); Under His Banner (1862); The Morgan Boys (1859); Rochester, a Story Historical (Rochester, 1884); The Midnight Cry (New York, 1886); Life of S. F. B. Morse (1887); and Papers Relating to the Genesee Country (1888), among other publications. A pioneer clubwoman, Parker founded the Fortnightly Ignorance Club of Rochester, New York, which was the first women's club in the state after Sorosis. Early life and education Permelia Jane Marsh was born in Milan, New York, on June 16, 1836. The father, Rev. Joseph Marsh, was a Campbellite minister, who adopted the views of William Miller and was a leader in the Second Advent movement in 1843-50. The mother, Sarah Adams Marsh, was a descendent from John Quincy Adams. Parker had two sisters, Sarah Eliza Marsh (1832-1900) and Mary Maria Marsh (1834-1900). She was educated in Rochester. Career On August 26, 1856, she married George Tan Parker, an attorney (and later a judge) of Rochester. Their children were, Richard Marsh Parker (1859-1934), George Force Parker (1866-1946), Henry Nelly Parker (1869-1970), and Margaret Marsh Parker (1871-1951).

She was one of the Spectator's Club contributors to The Outlook, and a member of the Contributors' Club, writing for the Atlantic Monthly. She wrote a number of children's stories as well as more important works. Parker's historical writings include histories of Rochester, the Genesee Valley, the Iroquois, and the Jesuits. Treating the Millerite delusions, which prevailed during her childhood, was a special literary field. She wrote the \"Little Millerite\", published in The Century Magazine in 1886. Shortly before that, she had published her novel, The Midnight Cry, a tale in which she gives a vivid account of the Millerite delusion, writing from personal knowledge, having been brought up in tha t faith. Parker was one of the founders of the Rochester Historical Society and was its first corresponding secretary. She was a member of Daughters of the American Revolution, Irondequoit Chapter, Rochester. She also had the distinction of founding the first women's club in New York state after Sorosis, the Fortnightly Ignorance Club of Rochester. Instead of starting out with the assumption that the members have an abundance of knowledge upon every subject, the principal plank in its platform is, \"We know nothing but seek knowledge\". It started with half a dozen members meeting in Judge Parker's office. It soon grew to several hundred members with the chamber of commerce for its headquarters. At meetings, a paper was read, questions followed, and the subject chosen for the next meeting, one of which the members knew little but wished to know much. Parker was one of the first women to oppose the placing of children in jails with hardened criminals, and it was largely through her efforts that the first matron was placed in the Rochester jail. She opposed women's suffrage. \"If I should ever vote, it would be to cast a ballot against woman's suffrage.\" Personal life Parker was the friend of many noted persons. She corresponded with Hall Caine, George William Curtis, Henry James, Eugene Field, Justin Winsor, Francis Parker, and Susan B. Anthony. Mark Twain wrote:— \"I greet you with pleasure; you were a good audience all by yourself.\" In 1911, Parker moved from New York to Escondido, California. She died of bronchial pneumonia in Los Angeles, California on March 13, 1913, at the home of her daughter, Margaret. Interment was at Mount Hope Cemetery, Rochester.

He planned the hate crime with two Nigerian brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, who had worked as extras on the set of television drama Empire, in which Smollett was a cast member. During the staged attack, which took place on East Lower North Water Street in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood, the disguised brothers shouted racial and homophobic slurs while one poured bleach on Smollett and the other placed a noose around his neck. In addition to falsely reporting that he had been attacked by two unknown individuals, Smollett described one of them as a white male. He also told police the men shouted \"MAGA country\" during the attack, a reference to the Trumpist political slogan \"Make America Great Again\". The brothers later testified that Smollett staged the attack near a surveillance camera so that video of it could be publicized. On February 13, 2019, Chicago police raided the home of the Osundairo brothers and found records indicating they had been paid $3,500 by Smollett.

On February 20, Smollett was indicted for disorderly conduct for paying the brothers to stage a fake hate crime and filing a false police report. His defense team reached a deal with prosecutors on March 26, 2019, in which all charges were dropped in return for Smollett performing community service and forfeiting his $10,000 bond. On April 12, 2019, the city of Chicago sued Smollett for the $130,000 cost of the investigation. In November he countersued, alleging he was the victim of \"mass public ridicule and harm\". On February 11, 2020, after further investigation by a special prosecutor was completed, Smollett was indicted again by a Cook County grand jury on six counts pertaining to making four false police reports. In December 2021, Smollett was convicted on five felony counts. On March 10, 2022, Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in county jail and was ordered to pay $120,106 in restitution for the overtime spent by Chicago police officers investigating his false reports. Smollett's attorneys immediately filed an appeal and he was released, pending the outcome of his appeal, on March 16 after posting a personal recognizance bond. Staged hate crime On January 22, 2019, a letter arrived at the Chicago studio of Smollett's employer. The letter was addressed to Smollett and had a drawing depicting a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing towards it, as well as lettered magazine clippings reading \"Smollett, Jussie you will die\" and \"MAGA\". The letter also contained a white powder determined to be Tylenol. On January 29, Smollett announced that he had been attacked early that morning on the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood, in what was initially investigated as a hate crime. Chicago police later alleged that Smollett himself was responsible for staging the attack. Smollett told police that he was attacked by two men, who were \"yelling out racial and homophobic slurs\" and who \"poured an unknown chemical substance on [him]\". He described one of the assailants as white, while in reality, both are black. They allegedly began to beat Smollett about the face, using their hands, feet, and teeth as weapons in the assault. According to a statement released by Chicago police, the two suspects then \"poured an unknown chemical substance on the victim\" and at some point during the incident \"wrapped a rope around the victim's neck\". Smollett said that he fought them off. There were surveillance cameras at the location that Smollett assumed had captured the incident, but as it turned out they were facing in the wrong direction. A witness who was near the scene of Smollett's alleged incident at the time said she heard nothing. According to Gloria Rodriguez, the lawyer for the assailants, Smollett first drove them to the spot where the attack was supposed to occur for a \"dress rehearsal\" and told them, \"Here's a camera, there's a camera and here's where you are going to run away\".

Smollett was treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Not seriously injured, he was released \"in good condition\" later that morning. The police had been called after 2:30 am by Smollett's manager, Frank Gatson, which infuriated the actor because he did not want to involve law enforcement. When they arrived around 2:40 am, Smollett had a white rope around his neck. He later admitted removing the rope and then putting it back on before the police arrived after Gatson told him to do so. Smollett said that the attack may have been motivated by his criticism of the Trump administration and that he believed that the alleged assault was linked to the threatening letter that had been sent to him earlier that month. The FBI would later investigate whether Smollett was involved in composing the letter. Initial public reaction On January 30, 2019, public figures expressed support for Smollett on social media. Entertainment industry figures, including Shonda Rhimes and Viola Davis, tweeted their outrage over the attack and support for Smollett. Democratic Senators and presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker both described the attack as an attempted modern-day lynching. Booker urged Congress to pass a federal anti-lynching bill co-sponsored by him and Harris. In an interview with April Ryan of AURN, President Donald Trump was asked about Smollett being attacked and said, \"I think that's horrible. It doesn't get worse.\" Smollett faced skepticism regarding his claim of being attacked; he responded by saying that he believed that, if he had said his attackers were Mexicans, Muslims, or black people, \"the doubters would have supported me much more ... And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.\" Investigation On February 13, 2019, Chicago police raided the home of two \"persons of interest\" in the case. The men, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, were Nigerian immigrant brothers who'd acted as extras on Empire, the television series in which Smollett was a main cast member. Police recovered bleach and other items from the home. The brothers were held in police custody on suspicion of battery but were not charged. According to their attorney, they knew Smollett from working on the show and had also spent time with him at a gym. The two men were released February 15 without being charged with a crime, with Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi stating their release was \"due to new evidence\" from the interrogations. Chicago police later told ABC News: \"Police are investigating whether the two individuals committed the attack—or whether the attack happened at all.\" On February 16, two unnamed police sources informed CNN that investigators had discovered evidence indicating that Smollett had paid the two brothers $3,500 to stage the attack.

On February 19, 2019, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said that she was recusing herself from the investigation due to her \"familiarity with potential witnesses in the case\", prompting criticism from her predecessor, Anita Alvarez. Foxx delegated the case to a subordinate. Foxx later acknowledged that she had been in contact with a member of Smollett's family about the case at an early stage when he was thought to have been a crime victim. Foxx added that Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson had reached out to the FBI about handing the Smollett case off to them, but had informed her that the agency was not interested. Foxx's office later asserted that she had not formally recused herself from the case; doing so would have required her to ask the court to appoint an outside attorney as a special prosecutor. Smollett hired crisis manager Chris Bastardi to represent him. Criminal charges, arrest, trial and conviction On February 20, 2019, Smollett was charged by a grand jury with a class 4 felony for filing a false police report. Smollett's felony count charge in Illinois carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison. Smollett hired attorney Mark Geragos in addition to Chicago-based attorneys Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson to work on his legal defense. The next day, Smollett surrendered himself at the Chicago Police Department's Central Booking station; shortly thereafter, CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi stated that Smollett \"is under arrest and in the custody of detectives\". Guglielmi also said that Smollett was named as suspect in a criminal investigation for filing a fake police report, under a class 4 felony. Later that day, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson held a press conference, gave details of the investigation, and explained how the department concluded that the alleged assault was staged. The brothers, Abimbola \"Bola\" (also known as Abel) and Olabinjo \"Ola\" Osundairo, who say they helped stage the attack, also said that Smollett came up with the idea to orchestrate the attack after the threatening letter he received did not generate as much attention as he had hoped it would. In addition to the rope around his neck, the original plan was to pour gasoline over him, but they decided to use bleach instead. Police alleged that the actor intended to further his career by tying the incident to racism in the United States and President Trump, and that Smollett sent himself the threatening letter. Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr. set Smollett's bail at $100,000; a friend of the actor paid a $10,000 bond, and Smollett was released from custody on February 21.

Foxx added that Johnson had agreed to make that request. On March 14, 2019, Smollett pled not guilty. Initial charges dropped On March 26, 2019, all charges filed against Smollett were dropped, with Judge Steven Watkins ordering the public court file sealed. First Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Magats said the office reached a deal with Smollett's defense team in which prosecutors would drop the charges in exchange for Smollett performing 16 hours of community service and forfeiting his $10,000 bond. The Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association (IPBA) said that the dismissal was \"highly unusual\", and that the \"manner in which this case was dismissed was abnormal and unfamiliar to those who practice law in criminal courthouses across the state. Prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges alike do not recognize the arrangement Mr. Smollett received. Even more problematic, the State's Attorney and her representatives have fundamentally misled the public on the law and circumstances surrounding the dismissal.\" It described several of the statements made by the State's Attorney and her representatives regarding the handling of the case as false or misleading. The National District Attorneys Association released a statement saying that a prosecutor should not take advice from politically connected friends of the accused, should not recuse herself without recusing the entire office, and noted that \"a case with the consequential effects of Mr. Smollett's should not be resolved without a finding of guilt or innocence.\" Magats made a statement saying that the decision was not an exoneration of Smollett: \"We stand behind the investigation, we stand behind the decision to charge him [...] The fact that [Smollett] feels that we have exonerated him, we have not. I can't make it any clearer than that.\" Then-Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel strongly criticized the decision, saying it was a \"whitewash of justice\" and that \"From top to bottom, this is not on the level.\" Police superintendent Johnson said that justice was not served. On March 27, 2019, the Chicago Police Department released the redacted police reports associated with the case. It was announced that the FBI is investigating why the charges were dismissed.

Shortly after being assigned as special prosecutor, possible conflicts of interest were raised after a $1,000 donation to Kim Foxx's campaign had surfaced. His work was put on hiatus as a hearing was called for to decide whether Webb should continue. In court, Judge Michael Toomin defended his appointment of Webb. The judge ruled Webb could continue to investigate as special prosecutor since his donation was \"a routine practice of lawyers\" and that it should have \"no effect on his ability to be fair and impartial\". On December 6, 2019, a Cook County Circuit Court judge signed search warrants ordering Google to turn over Jussie Smollett's emails, photos, location data and private messages from November 2018 to November 2019, as part of the special prosecutor's investigation. Webb announced new charges on February 11, 2020. Smollett was indicted on six counts of felony disorderly conduct for lying to the police. According to the special prosecutor, Smollett \"faces six felony counts of disorderly conduct stemming from four separate false reports that he gave to police.\" Trial In March 2021, Smollett attempted to hire lawyer Nenye Uche to represent him, but prosecutors challenged the appointment with allegations of conflicts of interest. The allegations stem from claims made by the Osundairo brothers to prosecutors that Uche had spoken to them about the facts of the case in 2019, with the Osundairos later writing sworn affidavits to back up their claims. Uche has denied the allegations, saying he only met the Osundairos' mother and a family friend, and only to tell them he could not represent them because they already had representation. As of October 16, 2021, a judge had denied the defense's request to dismiss the case. Jury selection for Smollett's trial took place on November 29, 2021. During the trial, Smollett's defense attorney accused the judge of attempting to attack her, by physically lunging at her during a sidebar, another Smollett attorney has previously made accusations of the judge making faces and snarling throughout the trial. The judge denied the claim as well as her motion for a mistrial. During the 2021 trial, the prosecution revealed video footage of Smollett and the two \"attackers\" in a car a few days before the attack. When questioned, Smollett testified he had arranged to workout with Abel, but cancelled the workout when Ola had shown up uninvited. Prosecutor Webb argued, in opening statements, that this was evidence of the group holding a \"dress rehearsal\" to devise the fake crime. During his testimony, Smollett claimed, for the first time, that he had engaged in a \"sexual relationship\" with Abimbola Osundairo, one of the two brothers he hired to stage the attack.

On March 10, 2022, Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in county jail, and was also ordered to pay $120,106 in restitution for the overtime spent by Chicago police officers. During the sentencing hearing, which lasted more than five hours, Judge James B. Linn excoriated Smollett from the bench, repeatedly calling him \"narcissistic, selfish, and arrogant\". Linn also indicated that Smollett perjured himself during his trial testimony. After being sentenced, Smollett engaged in several outbursts in the courtroom, during which he proclaimed his innocence. He also repeatedly shouted that he is \"not suicidal\". On March 16, 2022, a three-person Illinois appeals court consisting of Judges Thomas Hoffman, Joy Cunningham and Maureen Connors ordered, in a 2-1 decision, that Smollett be released from jail, upon his posting of a $150,000 personal recognizance bond, pending the outcome of the appeal of his conviction. Hoffman and Cunningham signed the order, while Connors opposed it. The court's ruling explained that if Smollett was not released pending appeal, it would be \"unable to dispose of the instant appeal before the defendant would have served his entire sentence of incarceration\". Under Illinois state law, Smollett was not required to post cash bond but must attend future hearings concerning his case. Smollett's attorneys also argued before the court that Smollett's health and safety would be in danger while he was incarcerated, an assertion that prosecutors disputed. , the Osundairo brothers have not been charged for their alleged role in the hoax. In December 2021, during the second trial, Abimbola took to Instagram in a post apparently mocking Smollett's claims, by posting a picture of himself with a towel wrapped around his own neck and invited his audience to caption the image, geo-tagging the image to Boystown, one of the largest LGBT communities in the Midwestern United States.

Members Grinnell will be joining the WaMaC Conference in 2023. History The conference was formed in 1983 by Norwalk, Clarke, Winterset and Saydel. In 1988, the conference doubles, adding Perry, Carlisle, Johnston and Nevada. In 1991, Perry and Saydel depart for the Raccoon River Conference, and Boone and Pella Christian join the conference. Carlisle and Nevada left the conference after the 1995–96 school year for the Raccoon River Conference. Clarke (Osceola) left the same year to join the reformed South Central Conference. Grinnell, Knoxville and Pella were added from the South Central Conference after it folded after the 1995–96 school year. (The Conference reformed with smaller schools the same year.) Oskaloosa also applied for membership but was denied so they joined the Southeast 7. After the 1997–98 school year, Johnston left for the CIML, and Winterset left for the Raccoon River Conference. Oskaloosa was added from the Southeast 7 Conference for the 1998–99 school year. At the turn of the century, the Little Hawkeye Conference was an eight team league consisting of Boone, Grinnell, Knoxville, Norwalk, Oskaloosa, Pella, Pella Christian, and Waukee. For the 2006–07 school year, Waukee, who had recently moved up to 4A status and was one of Iowa's fastest growing school districts, left the league for the Central Iowa Metro League. They were replaced by Newton, whose recently resignation from the CIML had coincidentally opened the door for Waukee to join the conference. South Tama, formerly of the WaMaC Conference also joined the league that year, and the conference played with nine schools until Boone left in 2009 to join the Raccoon River Conference, a much better geographical fit for the school. South Tama left the conference for the North Iowa Cedar League in 2011. Indianola High School explored the option of leaving the Central Iowa Metro League to join the league, however, in June 2010, the Indianola School Board voted unanimously to stay in the CIML. Indianola is still a 4A school, but is seeing its enrollment figures drop and is now the smallest school in the CIML. In late 2012, Dallas Center–Grimes was admitted into the league as its eighth member for the 2013–14 school year. However, membership reverted to seven for the 2014–15 school year, as Knoxville moved to the South Central Conference. Indianola then joined the Conference from the CIML for the 2016–17 school year Grinnell will leaving for the WaMac Conference in the near future.

It is located in the far south of the country, just near the borders with France and Luxembourg. It is a French speaking city, though the traditional language is Luxembourgish. The poet and novelist Hubert Juin (1926–1987) was born in Athus. The city was famous during the 19th and 20th century because of its steelworks factory which closed in the 1970s. Geography The city is surrounded by two boundaries: the one with France and the other one with Luxembourg. The city was built around the Messancy river and the river Chiers, both right tributaries to the Meuse. Directly across the border with Luxembourg is the town of Rodange and the town of Pétange is to the east. On the French side, the main neighbouring city is Longwy in Meurthe-et-Moselle, over 5 km to the south west. Athus is situated at 200 kilometers from Brussels, 25 from Luxembourg City and 15 from Arlon. History Athus has always been a Germanic place though its first origins are during the Roman period. It was a little village until the 17th century when the steelworks began to develop in the whole region. It was during the 19th century that Athus started to become relatively famous in the neighborhood and especially in 1872 when the first steel factory was founded. At the same time, in 1878, Athus also became an independent commune until the reorganization of the 1970s, when it was merged with the surrounding communes to create the enlarged municipality of Aubange on 1 January 1977. But 1977 was a tragic year for the city because the factory closed its doors due to the iron and steel crisis of that moment. At that time, the city was at the top of its fame and of its number of inhabitants which reached approximately 7,500. That event led to a social and economic crisis for the city and the whole region which is not yet totally solved today. But Athus is still the biggest locality of the municipality of Aubange, and the most important because many services are still there; (the townhall, the main schools, the main bus lines stops and train station, the police station or the firehouse are examples.) Steelworks The steelworks in Athus was founded in 1872 as the company Société des Hauts Fourneaux d'Athus, a blast furnace was constructed and in 1880 a steelworks. In 1882, the company became Société des Hauts Fourneaux et Aciéries d'Athus; by 1914 there were four blast furnaces, and by 1928 five. In 1927 merger with the S.A. des Aciéries d'Angleur et des Charbonnages belges de Tilleu formed S.A.",

Production continued until the steel works at Athus was merged with the Minière et Métallurgique de Rodange (MMR) in 1973; restructuring as a result of the Steel crisis of the 1973–75 recession led to the complete closure of the plant in Athus in the late 1970s. The site of the plant is now a rail-served container terminal which deals with containers from the ports of the North Sea to the interior of France, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium. Demographics Athus had a population of 7227 inhabitants in January 2012. Transportation Athus has a railway station, which connects it to other stations in the Belgian railway network and to those of Luxembourg and France. It is connected hourly to Luxembourg City and Esch-sur-Alzette for the Luxembourgish part, and also hourly to Arlon, Libramont and Virton on the Belgian routes. This railway route hosts cargo trains as well as passenger trains and has been operating for a number of years. The city is situated just 10 kilometres south of European highway E 411/E42 between Luxembourg and Brussels. Culture Museums Athus has two museums: Athus et l'acier (Athus and Steel), which is about the history of the steelworks and the factory of the city. L'Univers des pompiers (fr) (The Fireman's World), which is about firemen. Religion Athus is Catholic, though today there is a very limited number of people who go to church The church is dedicated to Saint Stephen and was built in 1833.

Consisting of rappers Prodigy and Havoc, they are considered to be among the principal progenitors of hardcore East Coast hip hop. Mobb Deep became one of the most successful rap duos of all time, having sold over three million records. Their best-known albums are The Infamous (1995), Hell on Earth (1996) and Murda Muzik (1999), and their most successful singles were \"Shook Ones (Part II)\" and \"Survival of the Fittest.\" They were known for their dark and hardcore delivery. The duo disbanded in 2012, but reunited the following year. Prodigy died in June 2017. Havoc is currently working on a new Mobb Deep album. Biography Early career Havoc and Prodigy met while both were students at the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan—a school that produced creatives like Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, Amy Heckerling, Lee Quiñones, and Fab Five Freddy. In 1991, they became a duo that went by the name Poetical Prophets. The name Poetical Prophets was a testament to Prodigy, then Lord-T (The Golden Child), and Havoc's gravitation toward New York conscious hip-hop. The duo began making a demo tape and employed a guerilla marketing approach to promote themselves. They would find the addresses of record label headquarters on the back of albums, bring a cassette player, and ask passing artists to listen to their music. The only artist who stopped to hear their music was Q-Tip of A Tribe Called Quest; Prodigy recalled, \"[Q-Tip] introduced us to Chris Lighty that day and a bunch of people in the Rush Associated Labels in the Def Jam office—that's how we met everybody.\" Shortly thereafter, Prodigy signed a solo demo deal with Jive Records and had an uncredited feature on the song \"Too Young\" by Hi-Five, which appeared on the Boyz n the Hood soundtrack.

The Source dubbed Poetical Prophets a \"dynamic duo ... that are fast making a big name for themselves in talent shows and radio stations in the New York area.\" The following year, the duo changed their name from Poetical Prophets to \"Mobb Deep,\" in part based on the suggestion of Puff Daddy who was courting them to be the first artists on his newly created imprint, Bad Boy Records. In choosing the moniker, Prodigy noted that \"we need[ed] something that described how we were living. When [we] got together to hang out, there would be thirty to forty of us, like a mob. The slang we used when we saw a whole bunch of guys together was . . . 'deep.' Both words together sounded good. Mobb Deep.\" In 1992, Mobb Deep signed with 4th & B'way Records. They released the single \"Peer Pressure\" in promotion of their debut album Juvenile Hell. The album was released in 1993 and featured production from DJ Premier, Large Professor, and Public Enemy-affiliate Kerwin Young. Later that year, Havoc made a guest appearance on the Black Moon album Enta da Stage, on a song titled \"U da Man.\" Rise to success The group saw its first major success with their second album, The Infamous, released in 1995. Mobb Deep catapulted to the top of the hardcore hip-hop scene through Havoc and Prodigy's straightforward narration of street life. In this album, Mobb Deep portrayed the struggles of living in New York City's Queensbridge Houses where Havoc grew up. Following the release of The Infamous, Mobb Deep became some of the most prolific artists of the East Coast. The album title was inspired by a friend Yamit, a Golden Gloves boxer, who resided on Havoc's block in Queensbridge. Prodigy noted \"[Yamit] had 'The Most Infamous' tattooed on his biceps in black ink. We were already Mobb Deep, but he dubbed us the Infamous Mobb Deep.\" The production of this album was very dark and sample-based thanks to Havoc, who produced the beats from this point forward, although Q-Tip also contributed to the production and mixing. Furthermore, the hit single \"Shook Ones Part II,\" a remix to the hit \"Shook Ones,\" received critical acclaim. In 2020, The Infamous was hailed by Rolling Stone as one of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Mobb Deep's third album, Hell on Earth was released in 1996, debuting at number six on the Billboard Album Chart; the album continued the duo's portrayal of harsh street life while further pushing them to the forefront of Hip Hop scene along with contemporary East Coast Rappers like The Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z, LL Cool J, Wu-Tang Clan and fellow Queensbridge rapper Nas. Nas as well as Method Man, Ghostface Killah and Raekwon of Wu-Tang Clan appear on Hell on Earth.

In 1997, Mobb Deep was featured on Frankie Cutlass Politics & Bullsh*t album track title, \"Know Da Game,\" which also featured Kool G Rap. In 1998, the duo collaborated with reggae dancehall artist Bounty Killer on the track \"Deadly Zone\" for the soundtrack to Blade, and were a featured artist on the remix of Mariah Carey's single \"The Roof (Back in Time),\" which was based around a sample of \"Shook Ones Part II\". In 1999, they released the Murda Muzik album, which had the majority of its songs unintentionally leaked due to extensive bootlegging, causing delays as the group recorded new songs to replace the leaked ones. This resulted in delays in the official album release. When the album was officially released, it eventually debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and quickly received Platinum certification and was further promoted by the popular single \"Quiet Storm\". Shortly afterward, Prodigy released his solo album H.N.I.C in which he collaborated with fellow artists like (B.G., N.O.R.E.) and producers (including The Alchemist, Rockwilder and Just Blaze). East Coast vs West Coast feud Mobb Deep was part of the infamous East Coast vs West Coast hip hop rivalry, that was fueled and increasingly promoted by the private media. The beef started when Snoop Dogg and the West Coast group, Tha Dogg Pound, released \"New York, New York.\" Mobb Deep, along with Capone-N-Noreaga and Tragedy Khadafi, responded with the song \"L.A L.A\" (This song can be found on Capone-N-Noreaga's debut album The War Report). \"L.A. L.A.\" was released during rapper Tupac Shakur's final days of incarceration. Members of Tupac's group, Outlawz, allegedly attended a Mobb Deep concert; they then visited with Tupac over public rumoring that the duo had snubbed them at the concert. Tupac dissed Mobb Deep on multiple tracks, including: \"Hit 'Em Up\" and \"When We Ride on Our Enemies\" in which Tupac makes light of Prodigy's sickle-cell disease. Additional Tupac diss tracks include: \"Bomb First (My Second Reply)\" where Tupac said \"You're barely breathin and \"Against All Odds,\" both of which were released on Tupac's posthumous studio album, The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory. Mobb Deep retaliated on their 1996 release of Hell on Earth, which contains a diss track entitled \"Drop a Gem on 'Em\". \"I was happy about it,\" Havoc told Jack Thriller. \"The nigga saying our names. I didn't know what the fuck the beef was about. I didn't even care. I was like damn, did you hear that? 2Pac dissing us.

The album marked a major stylistic change in which the duo moved away from a raw, minimalist, stripped-down beat toward a commercial friendly in terms with such songs as \"Hey Luv (Anything).\" This transition fostered accusations of \"selling out.\" In 2003, the group split with Loud Records and released Free Agents: The Murda Mixtape, in which Havoc and Prodigy proclaimed themselves \"free agents\" and addressed the group's split with its old label and its search for a new label. Jive Records signed the duo later in the year through a deal with the group's own imprint. Mobb Deep then released Amerikaz Nightmare in 2004. The record sold poorly and led to the group's departure from the label.

On June 20, 2017, Prodigy died from accidental choking in Las Vegas, Nevada, while hospitalized for complications caused by sickle cell anemia. Legacy Mobb Deep helped popularize the 1990s slang called the \"Dunn language,\" a term first recorded in the 1999 single \"Quiet Storm,\" in which Prodigy raps: \"you's a dick blower, [you] tryin' to speak the Dunn Language?/ \"what's the drilly\" with that though? \"It aint bangin\"/ you hooked on Mobb phonics, Infamous 'bonics.\" The term \"dunn\" supposedly originated in the Queensbridge housing projects with an acquaintance of Prodigy's, Bumpy, whose speech impediment prevented him from pronouncing the letter \"S,\" such as in \"son.\" The impediment encouraged him to put the tongue on the two front teeth/palate, making a 'th' or a 'd' sound. Mobb Deep has attempted to claim ownership of this body of slang; additionally, they were going to release an album called The Dunn Language, in 2002, but the project was shelved, due to label issues.

He was able to appear at Wembley just a few months later in the starting eleven for West Ham in the Charity Shield against Liverpool. In all, he made 151 League appearances for the east London club and scored one goal (against Queens Park Rangers on 1 January 1985), before leaving the club in September 1985 for Crystal Palace. He spent three seasons with Palace, followed by another three with Southend United, then moved into non-league football with clubs including Enfield and Heybridge Swifts. Coaching career Brush joined Leyton Orient as youth coach in 1994, was appointed manager in October 2001, and was sacked after two years in charge with the club second bottom of the league. Steve Tilson, appointed manager of Southend United in late 2003, brought in Brush as his assistant, and the pair led the club to two successive promotions, from League Two to the Championship. After not recording a league win in 2010, the club slipped into the League One relegation zone and he was sacked as assistant manager on 8 March. Chairman Ron Martin stated he wanted a positive approach to the on-field activities. The next day former manager David Webb replaced Brush until the end of the season.",

In ancient and classical periods, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, followed by Buddhism were the primary religions in the region. Islam gradually became the primary religion in the region after first being introduced in the 7th century A.D., when the Rashidun Caliphate conquered parts of the region. The religion Zoroastrianism is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder Zoroaster is thought to have lived and died in Balkh while the region at the time was referred to as Ariana. Ancient Eastern Iranian languages may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the Medes and incorporated Arachosia, Aria, and Bactria within its eastern boundaries. An inscription on the tombstone of Darius I of Persia mentions the Kabul Valley in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered.

Thus the region is also considered as a \"second fatherland for Zoroastrianism\". Mainly concentrated in eastern and southern regions of present-day Afghanistan, early Indo-Aryan inhabitants (between 2000 and 1500 BCE) were adherents of Hinduism. Notable among these inhabitant groups were the Gandharis and Kambojas, while the Pashayi and Nuristanis are contemporary examples of these Indo-Aryan Vedic people. With a component of Vedic ancestors from the Pakthas, Pashtuns, the majority ethnic group in Afghanistan, also widely practiced Hinduism and Buddhism. Following Alexander the Great's conquest and occupation in the 4th century BC, the successor-state Seleucid Empire controlled the area until 305 BC when they gave much of it to the Indian Maurya Empire as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans brought Buddhism from India and controlled parts of southern and eastern Afghanistan until about 185 BC when they were overthrown. In the 7th century, the Umayyad Arab Muslims entered into the area now known as Afghanistan after decisively defeating the Sassanians in the Battle of Nihawand (642 AD). Following this colossal defeat, the last Sassanid Emperor, Yazdegerd III, became a hunted fugitive and fled eastward deep into Central Asia. In pursuing Yazdegerd, the Arabs chose to enter the area from north-eastern Iran and thereafter into Herat, where they stationed a large portion of their army before advancing toward the rest of Afghanistan. The Arabs exerted considerable efforts toward propagating Islam amongst the locals. A large number of the inhabitants of the region of northern Afghanistan accepted Islam through Umayyad missionary efforts, particularly under the reigns of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (caliph from 724 to 743) and Umar ibn AbdulAziz (caliph from 717 to 720). During the reign of Al-Mu'tasim Islam was generally practiced amongst most inhabitants of the region and finally under Ya'qub-i Laith Saffari, Islam was by far, the predominant religion of Kabul along with other major cities of Afghanistan. Later, the Samanids propagated Islam deep into the heart of Central Asia, as the first complete translation of the Qur'an into Persian occurred in the 9th century. Since the 9th century, Islam has dominated the country's religious landscape. Islamic leaders have entered the political sphere at various times of crisis, but rarely exercised secular authority for long. Remnants of the Hindu Shahi dynasty in Afghanistan's eastern borders were expelled by Mahmud of Ghazni during 998 and 1030. Until the 1890s, the country's Nuristan region was known as Kafiristan (land of the kafirs or \"infidels\") because of its inhabitants: the Nuristani, an ethnically distinctive people who practiced Animism and ancient Hinduism. By the 20th century, Islam made up as much as 99 percent of the population. The country's religious minorities such as Hindus and Jews did, however, enjoy \"complete religious freedom\" as of the early 1970s. The 1979 Soviet invasion in support of a communist government triggered a major intervention of religion into Afghan political conflict.

The PDPA imprisoned, tortured and murdered many members of the religious establishment. After National Reconciliation talks in 1987, Islam became once again the state religion and the country removed the word \"Democratic\" from its official name. From 1987-1992, the country's official name was the Republic of Afghanistan. The Sikh, Hindu, Christian, and Zoroastrian minorities have declined since; in the 1970s, it is estimated the country had around 500,000 Sikhs and 200,000 Hindus, while perhaps 7–10,000 remained in 2017. The Taliban won the Afghan Civil War in the 1990s and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996-2001), an Islamic state and theocracy that imposed the Taliban's version of Islam on the parts of the country it controlled. After the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, a new Islamic Republic was established in 2004 that combined state-sponsored Islam and democracy, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. With the fall of the Republic in 2021 and the return of the Taliban, it remains to be seen how the new Taliban treat the matter; their harsh suppression of journalism and foreigners have made getting reliable reports on the religious situation in Afghanistan difficult. For Afghans, Islam represents a potentially unifying symbolic system which offsets the divisiveness that frequently rises from the existence of a deep pride in tribal loyalties and an abounding sense of personal and family honor found in multitribal and multiethnic societies such as Afghanistan. Mosques serve not only as places of worship, but for a multitude of functions, including shelter for guests, places to meet and converse, the focus of social religious festivities and schools. Almost every Afghan has at one time during his youth studied at a mosque school; for some this is the only formal education they receive. Minority religious groups Demographics A Pew Forum data report in 2009 stated that Sunni Muslims constituted 80-85% of the population, with Shia Muslims making up 10-15%. Other religious groups, mainly Hindus, Sikhs, Baha’is and Christians, together constitute less than 0.3 percent of the population. There were a few hundred Ahmadiyya Muslims and no Jews in the country. Shia Islam The Shias make up between 7% and 20% of the total population of Afghanistan. Although there is a tiny minority Sunnis among them, the majority of Hazaras are Shia, mostly of the Twelver branch with some smaller groups who practice the Ismailism branch. The Qizilbash of Afghanistan have traditionally been Shias. Shia Muslims in Afghanistan are a source of tension between Afghanistan and its neighbor the Islamic Republic of Iran. The reigning Taliban are fiercely Sunni, while Iran is dominated by Shia Islam. As such, treatment of Afghanistan's Shia minority affect relations with one of Afghanistan's most important neighbors.

Description The falls is in a deep rock niche on the southern slope of the Karash range, where Bear Creek flows from under the Zhambas Pass. It has a glacial origin. According to geologists, about a million years ago significant tectonic movements formed the streambed. The falls is at 1521 meters elevation. Its height is 28 meters, with a water flow is 0.4 cubic meters per second. The falling water forms a cloud of water vapor. The temperature of the stream does not exceed 12 degrees.

In addition to owning and managing many of the largest circuses in the United States, he was also a rancher, a real estate developer and art collector. He was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 1987. Early circus life John was born in McGregor, Iowa, the fifth son in a family of seven sons and a daughter born to a French mother, Marie Salomé Juliar, and German father, August Ringling (a farmer and harness maker). The original family name was \"Ruengeling\". Five of those sons worked together to build a circus empire. The Ringlings started their first show in 1870 as \"The Ringling Bros. United Monster Shows, Great Double Circus, Royal European Menagerie, Museum, Caravan, and Congress of Trained Animals\", charging a penny for admission. In 1882, it was known as \"The Ringling Bros. Classic and Comic Concert Company\". By 1889, the circus was large enough to travel on railroad cars, rather than animal-drawn wagons. In 1905, John married Mable Burton. In 1907, the brothers bought the Barnum & Bailey circus for $400,000 from the estate of James Anthony Bailey and ran the two circuses as separate entities until the end of the 1918 season. John worked the circus with his brothers, declaring \"We divided the work; but stood together.\" John took the advance position, traveling ahead and booking the appearances and Charles was the operating manager.

In the early 1900s the ranks of the brothers began thinning as Otto died unexpectedly in 1911. Four years later, the oldest sibling, Al Ringling also died, followed by brother Henry in 1918. At the same time that family management was evolving, the Ringlings were challenged by keeping two mammoth circuses touring during World War I. Manpower shortages, combined with railroad restrictions and the 1918 flu pandemic all contributed in the decision to merge the Ringling Bros World's Greatest Shows and the Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show on Earth at the end of the 1918 season. On October 8, 1918 the Ringling Bros. season concluded after performances in Waycross, Georgia, and the circus trains were routed to the Barnum & Bailey Winter Quarters in Bridgeport, Connecticut. During the winter of 1918-19 the two circuses were combined into one enormous show, and on March 29, 1919, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus debuted at Madison Square Garden in New York City. After the death of Alf T. Ringling in 1919, brothers John and Charles made the decision to move the Winter Quarters to Sarasota, Florida, in 1927 where the brothers were having success in real estate speculation. Although a resident of Sarasota, Charles died in 1926 before the move was complete. With the death of brother Charles, John was now the last of the Ringling brothers. Although other family members had inherited stock in the company, as President he continued to manage the circus in the years prior to The Great Depression. During the 1920s, Ringling built Gray Crag, a 20-room manor house on an estate that was their summer residence in Alpine, New Jersey, atop the New Jersey Palisades and overlooking the Hudson River. Ringling would bring the circus troupe across the river from Yonkers, New York, with acrobats and animals to entertain their guests at parties. With the financial and personal difficulties that Ringling faced during the Great Depression, control of the property was lost and the house was ultimately demolished in November 1935. In 1909 John and his wife, Mable began spending their winters in Sarasota. The couple bought bay front property from Mary Louise and Charles N. Thompson, another circus manager who engaged several members of the Ringling family in land investments on the Florida Gulf Coast. Ringling commissioned a 30-room mansion which was inspired by the Venetian Gothic palaces, designed by New York architect Dwight James Baum, and built by Owen Burns, It was completed in 1926 and named Cà d'Zan, \"The House of John\" in the Venetian dialect of Italian.

In addition he was a world traveler as he was always looking for new acts for his circus. It was during these travels to Europe that he began establishing a collection of old world masterpieces and a collection of Baroque art including four cartoons for tapestries by Peter Paul Rubens. In 1929, John Ringling bought the American Circus Corporation, which consisted of the Sells-Floto Circus, the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus, the John Robinson Circus, the Sparks Circus, Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, and the Al G. Barnes Circus. He bought them from Jerry Mugivan, Bert Bowers, and Ed Ballard, for $1.7 million (approximately $ today). With that acquisition, Ringling owned all of the major traveling circuses in America. In 1933, the last of the Brothers Ringling, ill and aging John, who had owned more circuses than any other man on earth and whose fortune was once estimated to be $50,000,000, hobbled into a Federal Court in Brooklyn to testify on the loan that brought him low. The firm that held his note was in bankruptcy. At a prize fight in 1929, Mr. Ringling related, he met William M. Greve, president of New York Investors, Inc. (realty), who agreed to lend him $1,700,000. As collateral Mr. Ringling put up one-half of all his circus stocks. Shortly afterward New York Investors sold the Ringling note to the now bankrupt subsidiary. While ill last year, Mr. Ringling had been unable to meet an interest payment of about $18,000. Financier Greve promptly marched out to Coney Island. Threatening to attach the circus receipts, Financier Greve demanded: \"Put all your assets in a bag and give them to me.\" That night, despite a fever of 104, Mr. Ringling was put in a wheelchair and brought to another room. Over the protest of his nurse he signed papers which gave most of his assets to New York Investors. Later he learned that swift Mr. Greve had formed a voting trust to hold the Ringling stocks and manage the circuses, another trust to hold some of the Titians, Rembrandts, Hals, Rubens from his famed collection in Sarasota, Fla.

It is the seventh largest city in Marathwada, and the 39th largest city in Maharashtra by population. Etymology and history Osmanabad derives its name from the last ruler of Hyderabad, the 7th Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan, of which the region was a part of until 1948. As per historical evidence, the district was ruled by the Mauryas, Satavahanas, Rashtrakutas, and Yadavas. In early centuries the city belonged to the Hindu Chalukyas and Devagiri Yadavas, but later became a part of the Bahmani and Bijapur kingdoms. For a period of time, Osmanabad was also ruled by the Mughals, Bahmani, Nizam and Adil Shah kingdoms. Before the Hyderabad Nizam's rule, it was under the control of the Mughal King Aurangzeb. Being under Nizam rule, the district did not celebrate its freedom when the rest of India became independent in 1947. However, in 1948, Hyderabad State was merged with independent India and the district became a part of the then Bombay State. It became a part of Maharashtra State when the State was formed in 1960. Osmanabad has a historical lineage dating back to the days of Marathwada, and even before that to several kingdoms of which the region was a part. Osmanabad was officially renamed as Dharashiv on February 2023. The name derives from the Dharashiv Caves. Geography The city of Osmanabad has an elevation of",

To date, White remains the longest-serving Clerk of Court for Hampshire County since the office's creation in 1757. As a prominent lawyer and court clerk, White taught jurisprudence. Many of White's law students later became eminent lawyers and public officials in their own right, including Henry Bedinger, United States House Representative and United States Ambassador to Denmark. During the American Civil War, White was concerned for the safety of the county's records and proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported for safekeeping. Because of White's efforts, Hampshire County land records survived the war, while those records that remained in the courthouse were destroyed. White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest because of his Confederate sympathies. White relocated to Richmond and served in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury. White was a member of the White political family of Virginia and West Virginia and was the son of prominent Virginia judge Robert White (1759–1831) and the father of West Virginia Attorney General Robert White (1833–1915) and Hampshire County Clerk of Court Christian Streit White (1839–1917). Early life and military career John Baker White was born on August 4, 1794, near Winchester in Frederick County, Virginia. White was the third and youngest child of prominent Virginia General Court judge Robert White (1759–1831) and his wife Arabella Baker (daughter of John Baker). Among his other relations, White was a great-great-nephew of United States House Representative Alexander White (1738–1804) and a great-nephew of another United States House Representative, Francis White (1761–1826). During the War of 1812, White enlisted in the United States Army as a soldier and was promoted to the military rank of ensign. Clerk of court career Following his service in the War of 1812, White settled in Romney, Virginia (now West Virginia) where he was appointed as deputy clerk for both the superior court and circuit court in Hampshire County in 1814. On March 20, 1815, White was qualified as Clerk of Court for both the superior and circuit courts of Hampshire County, and he continued to hold these offices through successive appointments and elections for 46 years between 1815 and 1861.

In addition to his law instruction, White was an active member of the Romney Literary Society. When the act of incorporation for Romney Academy was amended by the Virginia General Assembly on March 25, 1839, White was appointed as a trustee along with other prominent Romney area residents David Gibson, Angus William McDonald, Daniel Mytinger, and John Kern, Jr. The 1839 act authorized any of the five appointed trustees of Romney Academy to fill vacancies on the board \"occasioned by death, resignation, removal, or legal disability\", thereby preventing future prolonged vacant trustee seats. Business affairs By 1839, White was serving on the board of directors of the Bank of the Valley of Virginia in Romney. During the absence of the board's president, David Gibson, White served as president pro tempore from November 29 until December 13, 1839. The Wirgman Building housed the Bank of the Valley of Virginia during White's tenure on its board of directors. American Civil War Prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War, White was in support of preserving the United States. In the United States presidential election of 1860, White supported Constitutional Union Party presidential candidate John Bell and his running mate Edward Everett. The Constitutional Union Party was formed by former Whig Party members seeking to avoid secessionism over the issue of slavery. In 1861, White voted for Union candidates to serve as delegates from Hampshire County in the Virginia secession convention, one of which was his son-in-law Colonel E. M. Armstrong. White's national loyalties shifted following the Battle of Fort Sumter and other Union encroachments into the Confederate States of America, after which White supported the defense of Virginia's states' rights and of the United States Constitution. White's eldest three sons out of four joined the Confederate States Army, and White became active in enlisting and arousing support within Hampshire County for the Confederate States cause. Because of his Confederate sympathies, White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest. Preservation of Hampshire County records No court proceedings convened in the county between 1861 and 1864, and the Hampshire County Courthouse was utilized as a stable by Union soldiers stationed in Romney during the war. In 1861, Union Army forces under the command of Lew Wallace occupied Romney following a minor battle there during which White \"kept close watch over\" the county's record books so that they would not be destroyed by Union forces. Later in the fall of 1861, Union Army forces under the command of Benjamin Franklin Kelley advanced upon Romney. Upon learning of this, White was again concerned for the safety of the county's records and proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported to Winchester for safekeeping.

White likely chose to transport the bound volumes of records, as the loose paper records would have been more cumbersome to keep together. In 1863, when Winchester was no longer a safe location for the storage of Hampshire County's records and they again risked destruction by Union Army forces, White's son Captain Christian Streit White took responsibility for the records and transferred them to Front Royal. When Front Royal became endangered by advancing Union Army forces, Captain White had the records moved to Luray Caverns where they remained for several months. In the fall of 1864, the county's record books were rescued by Captain White and his company as Union Army troops were in the process of destroying them. Captain White's company loaded about 150 record books into a wagon, and they were taken to North Carolina where they remained safely for the duration of the war. Hampshire County's land records survived and were returned to the courthouse following the conclusion of the American Civil War, likely by a soldier returning to the area from North Carolina. Had White not separated the records and sent the bound volumes away for safekeeping, Hampshire County would have lost all its records during the course of the war, as those that remained in the courthouse were destroyed. In addition to the desecration of the courthouse's loose paper records, either a Union Army officer or an Indiana unit confiscated an old Scots language Bible belonging to White, which had been passed down to him from his grandfather, John White. The \"old Scots Bible\" was purportedly taken as punishment against White for his support of the Confederacy. Removal to Richmond White left Romney with his wife and youngest children and traveled to Richmond where he was offered a position in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury within the government of the President of the Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis. Death and legacy White died soon after his arrival in Richmond on October 9, 1862. He was interred by Scottish Rite Masons at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. Distant relative Reverend Moses D.

White and his second wife, Frances, had ten children (one of which died in infancy): Residence White and his family resided in a large brick mansion located along East Main Street (Northwestern Turnpike) which was later known as \"Liberty Hall\". Due to his upbringing in an affluent family, White was a person of means from a young age, and in his early adulthood he was able to construct a \"large brick mansion\" at this location. His original residence was destroyed by fire in 1857, and White replaced it with a more modest brick edifice where he resided until his departure from Romney in 1861 during the American Civil War. White's home was a \"seat of true old Virginia hospitality\" and it was frequented by all socio-cultural strata of Hampshire County and the greater Valley of Virginia region. During the construction of the Northwestern Turnpike through Romney, the state superintendent for the project, Angus William McDonald, proposed building the thoroughfare through White's garden in front of his residence White won an appeal in court which caused the turnpike to be rerouted, thus creating the present curve on East Main Street in front of White's former residence.

That night, Toppema meets Shinnosuke and explains that the tale of Henderland is in fact real and Joma and Makao lead a force of creatures that can control dark magic but are vulnerable to the magic of magical cards, the reason she wants him to help her is because the cards can only be used by living beings. Despite being shown the power of the cards, Shinnosuke refuses to help Topemma. She leaves the cards with him. Joma and Makao send Snowman to retrieve the magical cards from Shinnosuke through.

It was released by Glassnote Records on December 2, 2016. Consisting of tracks being sung rather than rapped, its fusion of psychedelic soul, funk and R&B influences was considered a bold departure from the predominantly hip hop style of his prior work. The album was produced by Glover and his longtime collaborator, Ludwig Göransson. \"Awaken, My Love!\" received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number five on the US Billboard 200. The album was supported by three singles, \"Me and Your Mama\", \"Redbone\" and \"Terrified\". It received Grammy Award nominations for Album of the Year and Best Urban Contemporary Album at the 2018 Grammy Awards. The single \"Redbone\" also earned nominations for Record of the Year, Best R&B Song, and won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&B Performance. Background On June 17, 2016, after a hiatus from social media, Glover tweeted \"pharos.earth\", a link to download his new app. The app itself placed the user in outer space looking at a small blue planet while a clock counted down to zero. The app then had the user crash down from space, placing them on a map that was located on Joshua Tree, California. The app then showed the dates of his upcoming performances in Joshua Tree, where the user could also purchase tickets. The concert festival was to debut the album and give the audience the \"full-album experience\". From September 3 to 5, nearly three months before the release of his album, Glover held three concert performances at Joshua Tree to debut the album. Glover wore glow-in-the-dark paint on his braids and a pink and yellow skirt, with his bandmates wearing similar attire. He performed eleven songs during",

Prior to the album's release, the cover artwork was included as an easter egg in the episode \"Juneteenth\" of Glover's FX series Atlanta.

On September 19, 2017, \"Terrified\" was sent to urban contemporary radio as the album's third single. Critical reception \"Awaken, My Love!\" was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 77, based on 25 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 7.4 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. Mosi Reeves of Rolling Stone wrote that \"\"Awaken, My Love!\" is an enthralling trip into the land of funk\", while Dan Bogosian from The A.V. Club wrote \"Is Childish Gambino suddenly the new Prince, a virtuoso multi-instrumentalist always ready to keep the world an arm's length away from knowing what he's thinking? Is he D'Angelo, a soul god fighting against his first image with all-time great music? No. He is Donald Glover, a man who can perform and write comedy, act in drama, and drop a truly wonderful album on short notice with all the influences and instructions spelled out\". Perry Kostidakis of the FSView & Florida Flambeau wrote that \"with each successive album, Childish Gambino has exhibited phenomenal growth, but no more than on his latest release. Unflinchingly ambitious and boldly different, \"Awaken, My Love\" calls back the sounds and themes of the 1970s funkadelic movement to provide a wholly original, emotional and immersive musical experience\", with The Guardians Gwilym Mumford adding \"only the limitations of his voice occasionally let him down – he doesn't quite have the range to nail Awakens more ostentatious vocal lines. Still, it's a minor gripe when there's so much here to enjoy\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times said, \"It's at once a homage and a parody, equally aware of that era's excesses and its glories, of the way that the most memorable 1970s R&B merged sensuality, activism, humor, toughness, outlandishness, futurism, soul roots, wild eccentricity and utopian community spirit. That's an extremely high bar, but at its best, \"Awaken, My Love!\" recalls many of those virtues\". Tim Sendra of AllMusic said, \"\"Awaken, My Love!\" is a stone-cold blast from beginning to end\".

Scott Glaysher of XXL said, \"Childish Gambino gets definite props for pushing the envelope and refusing to operate within any genre confinements on this refreshing 49-minute trip through the funkadelic 1970s. While these blurred lines make this album a little hard to follow, \"Awaken, My Love!\" proves his versatility as a rapper turning over a new leaf\". Kitty Empire of The Observer said, \"Throughout, Glover's genre fluency is unimpeachable; the only minor drawback is the overmannered air of some of these period pieces, where there could be more straight-up abandon, as on the persuasive 'Me and Your Mama'. Vice negatively described the album as \"pure Funkadelic cosplay\".

He worked in the National League from 1998 to 1999, and throughout both major leagues since 2000. He was promoted to Crew Chief for the 2018 MLB season when Dale Scott retired after the 2017 MLB season. Umpiring career Wegner has umpired in ten Division Series (2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2017, 2019, 2020), five League Championship Series (2007, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018), and two World Baseball Classics (2009, 2013). He also officiated in the 2008 All-Star Game, the 2014 and 2018 National League Wild Card Games, and the 2013 World Series and recently the 2017 World Series. Wegner wears uniform number 14, and previously wore uniform number 47. For the 2018 regular season he was found to be a Top 10 performing home plate umpire in terms of accuracy in calling balls and strikes. His error rate was 7.28 percent. This was based on a study conducted at Boston University where 372,442 pitches were culled and analyzed. Controversy On June 2, 2007, Wegner was involved in a heated argument with Chicago Cubs manager Lou Piniella. After Wegner ruled that Ángel Pagán was out at third on an attempted steal, Piniella, who later acknowledged the call was correct, stormed out of the dugout, threw his hat down, and started kicking dirt on Wegner. Piniella would be ejected and given a four-game suspension and he later apologized to Wegner.

Clearways aim to improve traffic flow at certain times of the day by prohibiting stopping in the lane next to the kerb, adding another lane to the roadway (when used on both sides of the road, two are added). In New South Wales clearways are indicated by a yellow broken line at the kerb and \"clearway\" signage (which indicates the times of the day upon which the clearway operates). In Perth, Western Australia, clearways operate between 7:30 and 9:00 am, and from 4:15 to 6:00 pm on weekdays. Parking meters do not accept payment during these times. New Zealand In New Zealand, a clearway is section of road on which it is illegal to stop for any reason other than a breakdown or an obstruction to the road such as stationary traffic. Clearways may operate at all times or for limited times such as peak traffic flow times. As such, they operate in a similar way to those in the United Kingdom. Similar signs are deployed on New Zealand clearways to British clearways, with a standard blue circle edged in red and featuring a red diagonal cross. If the clearway is for limited periods only, this will be indicated by a small sign below the clearway sign. Whereas in the United Kingdom a further notice with the word \"Begins\" or \"End\" will indicate the extent of a clearway, in New Zealand this is indicated by small signs featuring red arrows, indicating the direction from the sign in which the clearway is in operation. Larger white signs with black or red text indicating the details of the clearway are also sometimes found, featuring an image of the red and blue circle (as on the regular signs) as a prominent feature. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, a clearway is a road or section of road on which it is illegal to stop on the main carriageway for any reason except in an emergency. Certain sections of urban road may be designated Urban Clearway, which is a little-used designation, but one which prevents vehicles being stopped during the peak hours, typically 07:00–09:30 and 15:00–18:00. Vehicles are permitted to stop only as long as necessary to pick up or set down passengers This allows the commuter traffic to flow more freely, but still allows for overnight and daytime parking when the road is not so busy.

Today the name exists only in connection with the church, a school in the nearby village of Henryd, and the nearby mountain ridge, Craig Celynnin. Llangelynnin Church (Welsh: Eglwys Llangelynnin) is possibly one of the remotest churches in Wales (), and is amongst the oldest; that at Llanrhychwyn, further up the valley, is a little older. The church is dedicated to Saint Celynnin, who lived in the 6th century and probably established the first religious settlement here. It lies at a height of about feet, above the village of Henryd in the Conwy valley, in the shelter of Tal y Fan (), the mountain to the south-west. A small and simple building, it probably dates from the 12th century (although some sources cite the 13th century), and was probably pre-dated by an earlier church of timber, or wattle and daub construction. Llangelynnin is also the name of the former parish, the primary school in nearby Henryd (Ysgol Llangelynnin). Celynnin's name is also carried by Craig Celynnin, a mountain ridge adjacent to the church. St. Celynnin Celynnin lived in the 6th century, and according to tradition was one of the sons of Helig ap Glanawg, a prince who lived at Llys Helig (in what is now known to a natural rock formation) before the sea inundated the land off the coast of Penmaenmawr.

Location Next to the church lie the remains of an Iron Age hut circle, and some stories romantically suggest that this was where St. Celynin himself lived. It is also reputed to have been used as a cockfighting ring. The church is overlooked from the north-east by the adjacent crags of Cerrig-y-ddinas, the site of an Iron Age hillfort. These crags afford wide views down the Conwy valley to the sea, and up the valley as far as Dolgarrog. Pathways Many old paths lie in the area, and these routes would have been established at a time when the hills were considerably more wooded. An old walled bridleway route leads east from the church, down through Parc Mawr, an area of woodland now owned by the Woodland Trust, who are replacing the Forestry Commission's 1960s-planted conifers with native species. The path through the wood leads towards the valley bottom, and to the west a route leads towards Penmaenmawr, past the Bronze Age standing stones of Maen Penddu. To the south-west a path meets the important Neolithic route and Roman Road passing through Bwlch-y-Ddeufaen, which connected the Conwy valley to the north coast near Llanfairfechan, and places further westwards. The church building The porch was added in the 15th century, and features an unusual \"squint window\" in its east (right) wall. Repairs to the porch roof were made using yew wood, and therefore it is quite possible that these came from the churchyard, which at one time contained trees. The door hinges and threshold date from the 14th century, although the door itself is more recent. The nave is the oldest part of the church, dating from the 12th century, and the present chancel was added later, probably in the 14th century. Originally the nave would not have been paved, as it is today, and indeed, the rear of the north chapel remains unpaved even today. The roof contains dark oak rafters. The north transept was added in the 15th century and was known as Capel Meibion, the \"men's chapel\". The window at the back of the chapel was a more recent addition. Opposite the north transept, a south transept was also added, probably in the 16th century. This was called Capel Eirianws (meaning \"Plum Orchard\", the name of a local farm), whose owner possibly had it built. This chapel was demolished in the 19th century, but some remains are still visible from outside. The present east window dates from the 15th century, and replaced a smaller 14th century window. Since demolition of the south chapel (and the gallery) in the 19th century, the church has changed little. Artifacts The twist-turned altar rails and the altar screen date from the 17th century.

The church once had a rood loft and gallery, and the remains of these can be seen in on the nave walls, and from the beam at the back of the church. The gallery was demolished in the 19th century. The reader's desk possibly dates from the 16th century, although the door is more recent. The wooden benches in the nave date from the 18th century, although at least one bench in the church dates from 1629. One bench (at the front of the north chapel) still bears the initials R.O.B., this being the Reverend Owen Bulkeley, a former rector, who died in 1737. A church inventory of 1742 records a particular bench which was used by women only. Just inside the church, on the wall, is a holy water stoup, used until the 19th century for making the sign of the Cross. At the back of the church is an octagonal font, which probably dates from the 13th or 14th century. The bell has no inscription and its date is therefore unknown. On the wall in the nave is a bier, used to carry the dead to the churchyard. Renovation Major renovation of the church was carried out in 1932 and in 1987. This later renovation work was carried out under the guidance of Gerald Speechley, and a plaque in the church records this. He died three years later. The churchyard The churchyard is walled, with an arched entrance in the eastern wall. Today it is almost devoid of tree growth, but this was not always so. The churchyard contains a fair number of gravestones, dating back to the 14th century. These graves were not dug in any uniform layout. Indeed, the rock outcrops to such a degree that finding space for graves has been a problem over the centuries. The Holy Well In the south-eastern corner of the churchyard is a well, Ffynnon Gelynin (sometimes known as \"The Holy Well of St. Celynin\"), a small walled rectangular pool, which was renowned for its power to cure sick children. One old story relates that parents would throw items of their sick child's clothing into the water. If the clothes floated their child would live. If they sank the child was destined to die of the illness. The well was once roofed over but this structure no longer exists. The walls around the well, and probably the benches too, were later additions made when the churchyard was restored. The presence of surface water at this elevation was probably the reason for its designation as a site for early settlement, and the holy well itself almost certainly predates the church.

The \"new\" church Llangelynnin church was used regularly until 1840, when it closed following depopulation of the area. A new church was consequently built, carrying the same name, nearer the centres of population. This church is situated close to the 15th century Groes Inn (on the B5106 road), on the road which runs from the inn to the village of Rowen. Whereas the old church reflects a simple mediaeval design, the new church was designed by Thomas Jones of Chester in a much grander, lofty late Georgian style. Unusually, the tower has a square lower storey surmounted by an octagonal embattled upper stage. The original plans of 1839 still exist . A plaque in the doorway refers to the \"re-erection\" of the building, implying perhaps that there was an earlier building on this site, but there is no evidence to this effect, and no gravestones pre-date 1839. The Religious Census of 1851 refers to it being erected in \"1839 or 1840\", but makes no reference to the Old Church.

This parish, which derives its name from the dedication of its church to St. Celynin, who flourished towards the close of the sixth century, is situated at the north-eastern extremity of the county, bordering upon Denbighshire. A memorable battle was fought at Cymryd, in or near the parish, in the year 880, between the forces of Anarawd, Prince of North Wales, and those of Edred, Earl of Mercia, who attempted the conquest of the country. In this conflict Anarawd was completely victorious; he drove the Mercians from the field of battle, and continued to pursue them until they were finally expelled from the principality: the victory was called Dial Rhodri, or \"Roderic's revenge,\" as Anarawd thus fully avenged the slaughter of his father Roderic in a descent of the Saxons upon Anglesey.

Based around either an IBM 1130 or an IBM 1800 computer, it supported up to 32 student work stations, each with a variety of audiovisual capabilities. Seeded by a research grant in 1964 from the U.S. Department of Education to the Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences at Stanford University, the IBM 1500 CAI system was initially prototyped at the Brentwood Elementary School (Ravenswood City School District) in East Palo Alto, California by Dr. Patrick Suppes of Stanford University. The students first used the system in 1966. The first production IBM 1500 system was shipped to Stanford University in August 1967. Preliminary versions of course materials that educators could use with the IBM 1500 were developed by Science Research Associates, Inc., an IBM subsidiary. Most educational programming on the IBM 1500 system was done in the specialized computer programming language called Coursewriter. The IBM 1500 system and its learning environment was a modern step in the history of virtual learning environments. Overview Buck and Hunka wrote in their 1996 retrospective and historical paper that: \"The IBM 1500 Instructional System was the only commercial system produced by a single manufacturer that had an integrated student terminal configuration providing a keyboard and light pen response mode, CRT-based graphics, audio, and static film projection. Experimental instructional systems had been developed by IBM prior to a prototype version of the 1500 Instructional System, which was tested at Stanford University. A production version of the 1500 System with changes in the CPU and the audio system and having the capability to run a maximum of 32 student stations was installed in over 31 sites beginning in the late 1950s. IBM's commitment to the development of this system was extensive but short-lived, as most sites were unable to maintain funding support for the system. In retrospect, the IBM 1500 System had capabilities yet to be supported on the microcomputer systems of the 1980s.\" Selected educational applications The Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) Division of the U.S. Army Signal Center and School (USASCS) at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey evaluated CAI's success in teaching basic electronics by using material presented in the tutorial mode on the IBM 1500 System, utilizing the IBM Coursewriter language, an IBM 1510 Display Console, and an IBM 1512 Image Projector.

Vincent was one of Claire Chennault's two top fighter commanders in the China Burma India Theater of World War II. He served as the model for two comic strip characters by Milton Caniff: \"Colonel Vince Casey\", and \"Brigadier General P.G. 'Shanty' Town\". Vincent planned and carried out daring offensive air tactics in China, forming the 14th Air Force Forward Echelon which staged out of forward airfields to attack the enemy unexpectedly. The successful concept was twinned and reorganized by Chennault into two mixed-aircraft groups, with Vincent commanding one of them, the 68th Composite Wing. A string of Allied victories throughout 1943 caused the Japanese to plan a major retaliatory move. Beginning in May 1944, the airmen were hit repeatedly and forced into retreat as the Japanese implemented Operation Ichi-Go. Vincent's men demolished their valuable airbases and fell back to Chennault's stronghold at Kunming. Vincent returned to the U.S. afterward, his tour of duty complete. Back home, Vincent was put in command of a training wing and in 1946 was asked to teach at the Air War College. Following this, he held the position of second-in-command of the Western Air Defense Force. Vincent died of a heart attack in 1955. The United States Air Force (USAF) named an air base after him in 1956: the Vincent Air Force Base in Yuma, Arizona. The airfield was turned over to the Marines in 1962, and is today the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma (Vincent Field). Early career Clinton Dermott Vincent was born in 1914 in the small town of Gail, Texas. His parents, Carvin Wyoming Vincent and the former Rosa Lee Burgess, produced 10 or 11 children—Vincent was the youngest. He was nicknamed \"Casey\" from youth. While still a small child, Vincent moved with his family to Natchez, Mississippi, where he went to school. After excelling in high school, Vincent was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, becoming a cadet on July 1, 1932.

In January 1937, during his primary training, his mother died in Natchez at the age of 65. Following primary, Vincent took the attack course in advanced flying at Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas. During a dance held at the officer's club, he met Margaret \"Peggy\" Hennessey, a young woman with an infant daughter, and fell in love. In November 1937, he was posted operations officer for the 19th Pursuit Squadron at Wheeler Field near Pearl Harbor. Hennessey traveled to Hawaii to be with him, and on February 10, 1938, they married—the couple celebrated the birth of a daughter named Thayer on December 17. The young father rose in rank to first lieutenant in June 1939, then was promoted to captain on October 7, 1940. In November 1940, Vincent transferred to the newly formed 35th Pursuit Group at Hamilton Field in Northern California where he served as squadron commander. The Group trained in several fighter aircraft types, including Seversky P-35s, P-36 Hawks, P-39 Airacobras and P-40 Warhawks. Vincent advanced to group operations officer, then executive officer, then in December 1941 was made group commander. On December 5, two days before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Vincent's wife pinned the gold leaves of a major on his shoulders. That evening, the 35th Pursuit Group shipped out for overseas duty in Manila, to join the group's 21st and 34th Squadrons already there. The next day Peggy Vincent began to drive her two daughters to San Antonio to be with family. On December 7 when Hawaii was attacked by Japanese naval forces, the unarmed ship carrying Vincent, traveling with no escort, was ordered to return immediately to San Francisco Bay. Vincent remained in California for another month, joined by his wife and daughter, during which time he learned that Manila had fallen, and that fellow Group pilot Sam Marrett, a friend from West Point, had died in its defense. On January 12, 1942, the USS Mariposa sailed in convoy with Vincent aboard, headed for the Far East. China Vincent arrived in Melbourne, Australia, in early February, then sailed in a different convoy to Perth. In March, he sailed to Karachi, India, and was posted to Karachi American Air Base, one of the more distant ports that supplied The Hump. There, Vincent served as Director of Pursuit Training for the Tenth Air Force at the rank of lieutenant colonel. Wishing for a combat post, in November 1942 he was ordered by Clayton Bissell, commander Tenth Air Force, to transfer to China to join General Claire Chennault and his China Air Task Force (CATF), a group formed from the Flying Tigers. Bissell's orders specified Vincent take the position of Chennault's executive officer, to apply a dose of West Point regimen to the haphazard CATF paperwork, but Chennault, irked at this maneuver by his distant superior, instead assigned Vincent operations officer.

All Colonel Scott (Robert Lee Scott, Jr.) cares about is fighting—and he is good at that!\" Vincent cared little what title he served under—he just wanted to fly in combat. After instituting procedural changes regarding the format of official reports originating from CATF, he assigned himself his first air combat flight on November 22, escorting bombers against the harbor of Haiphong on the coast of French Indochina, during which he dropped a bomb from his fighter into the harbor's dock area. Five days later, he scored his first aerial victory: a fixed-undercarriage Japanese fighter he encountered during an attack on Canton in which 10 B-25s and 22 P-40s downed some 16 to 22 enemy aircraft. Vincent noted that he was effectively serving three desk jobs—Exec', 'Intelligence', and 'Operations—but that Chennault was pleased to find his new administrator a skilled pilot eager to fight. In the final weeks of 1942, the CATF was often grounded by bad weather. Vincent flew combat in Peggy I on December 12, but two days later he was ordered by Chennault, at Bissell's insistence, to refrain from flying a mission he had planned. Another pilot took Peggy I on that mission but belly-landed the aircraft on a road. Vincent borrowed a different aircraft to fly reconnaissance missions on December 17 and 19, but stayed on the ground again during a short visit by Bissell, to satisfy his expectations. General Joseph Stilwell flew in on December 22 to award Chennault the Distinguished Service Medal, and to take him to Chungking, the provisional wartime capital of China. Left in charge of CATF for the rest of December, Vincent led the combat missions he put together. On December 24 he was awarded the Silver Star for his combat performance. In early January 1943, Vincent was officially made executive officer of the CATF, taking over the multiple leadership roles held previously by Scott and by Merian C. Cooper, who were both heading home. He checked out in a C-53 transport, flew it to Chungking for a \"short visit with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek\", and was promoted to colonel. On January 24, Albert \"Ajax\" Baumler flew a captured and repaired Mitsubishi A6M Zero from Kweilin, and Vincent put it through its paces to become one of only five pilots in the \"Zero Club\"—China-based U.S. pilots who test-flew this particular aircraft. Starved of fuel and supplies in February, the CATF mounted few missions; during the same period, Commanding General of the USAAF Henry H. Arnold visited with Chennault and Vincent to inform them that a group of fuel-hungry heavy bombers were to be assigned to the CATF, under Colonel Royden Eugene Beebe, Jr. Fourteenth Air Force On March 10, 1943, the China Air Task Force became the Fourteenth Air Force, and Vincent was made chief of staff.

This bold thrust into enemy-held territory put all major Japanese airbases from north China to Indochina and Thailand under threat of U.S. air attack. Flying Peggy II, a new P-40K he received on June 2, Vincent racked up four more aerial victories, making him an ace, then number six on August 26, 1943. For this, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Legion of Merit; the latter \"for outstanding leadership of a small force, which, against numerically superior air strength, succeeded in disrupting enemy communications and routing troop columns.\" Chennault forbade him from any further combat missions. Meanwhile, back home in San Antonio, Texas in early 1943, Peggy Vincent wrote to cartoonist Milton Caniff to tell him that her husband was working under Chennault in China, much like the characters in Caniff's comic strip Terry and the Pirates. Peggy Vincent sent Caniff photographs of her husband and told the cartoonist about his flying exploits. Caniff worked the flier into his comic strip as \"Colonel Vince Casey\" around March 1943. In September and October 1943, Vincent was rotated back home on leave during which he met Caniff. Nine months after the visit, a second daughter was born to the Vincents, named Patricia. Upon his return to CBI, Vincent was informed that reconnaissance flights over Formosa (Taiwan) showed a growing concentration of Japanese aircraft. To Vincent, they appeared vulnerable to attack from advance bases, so he and Hill planned a long-range mission. On Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1943, Vincent sent Hill in command of a mixed force of eight early Allison-engined P-51 Mustangs, eight P-38 Lightnings and fourteen B-25 Mitchells against 100 bombers and 112 fighters at Hsinchu Air Base—the attackers destroyed 15 of 20 defending fighters as well as 27 enemy bombers on the ground without loss to themselves. Four days later flying escort to B-24 Liberator heavy bombers, Vincent led the 23d Fighter Group against Tien Ho airdrome at Canton—the group shot down 13 of 20 defending fighters. The Formosa attack was one of the most devastating in the CBI Theater—it catalyzed the Japanese to lay plans to invade and seize the advance airfields Vincent had developed in east China. These plans became one of the two primary goals of Operation Ichi-Go, Japan's 1944 invasion of east China. As an expansion of the 14th Air Force Forward Echelon, the 68th Composite Wing was formed in December 1943. Vincent commanded the 68th for its first year. The mixed unit was composed of fighters, fighter bombers and medium bombers, flown by both American and Chinese airmen. Vincent flew a B-25 Mitchell bomber to lead his men in some of the bombing raids. More than 500,000 tons of Japanese shipping were sunk by Vincent's airmen, and the Japanese air power was greatly reduced south of the Yangtze River.

Among other officers mentioned, Vincent was described as tall, , a six-kill ace and the prototype for the cartoon character Vince Casey. Of Vincent, Caniff said that he \"picked his brain\" about living and fighting conditions in China. Vincent commanded the 68th Composite Group with Tex Hill as his deputy during the whole of the Japanese Operation Ichi-Go of 1944. The Americans in their advance bases were thrown on the defensive. In late June, Vincent ordered the evacuation of the base built at Hengyang, destroying it with explosives so that the Japanese could not make use of the buildings or the airstrip. Directly afterward, Vincent was called to attend a formal dinner with American and Chinese generals and ambassadors, honoring Vice President Henry A. Wallace who was on a fact-finding mission. Meeting after dinner in his office, Vincent told Wallace \"the unvarnished truth—that, barring a miracle, the Japanese will have all of east China by July 15!\" Japanese supply problems in east China were as critical as American ones, and the Japanese advance was slowed until September when Vincent was forced to retreat and destroy his advance base at Tanchuk. The same treatment befell his own headquarters at Kweilin in October. As he circled Kweilin one final time in his command B-25, he said to Time magazine writer Theodore H. White (who was evacuating as well), \"I'm going to write a book about this campaign. I'm going to call it Fire and Fall Back.\" A month later, Vincent's HQ, relocated to Liuchow, was abandoned, with the 68th retreating to the 14th Air Force stronghold at Kunming.

Life Tate was born in 1747 at Gawber Hall, near Barnsley, where his father was a glass maker and was christened on 14 November in Darton near Barnsley He was educated at Woolton near Liverpool where his brother Richard Tate lived and had Joseph Wright of Derby as his lodger in 1769. Richard was an amateur painter and was well connected. William Tate then became Wright's student. It was with Joseph Wright in 1772 that William Tate first exhibited at the Society of Artists in London where he became a fellow. Over the next twenty years Tate exhibited in Manchester (1773), Liverpool (1774–1787) and London (1778–1787) at the Royal Academy of Art. Both Tate and Joseph Wright quarrelled with the Academy of Art which cannot have assisted Tate's career. In LIverpool however he enjoyed good support and in 1784 his work was exhibited in Liverpool with the same prominence as Joshua Reynolds. In 1787 William Tate moved to Manchester where he enjoyed a number of good commissions for portraits. Daniel Daulby had himself and both of his wives painted by Tate. He moved south to Bath in 1804 where he died in 1806. The Walker Art Gallery has a number of William Tate's portraits of notable men and women of the day including Daniel Daulby, and the sister of William Roscoe.

While Shirou is overpowered and defeated, he manages to buy enough time for the ritual to complete and Miyu is transported away. Miyu then wakes up in an alternate Fuyuki, now with the objective of finding the cards. Voice cast Production Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a spin-off manga to the visual novel Fate/stay Night written by Kinoko Nasu centered around Shirou Emiya and three parallel storylines regarding his participance in the Holy Grail War. Although the manga focuses on the title character Illya, Hiroyama wrote a series of flashbacks in Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya 3rei! centered around Shirou and Miyu. Already experienced in drawing Shirou before he started working on Illya's spin-off manga, Hiroyama had no problems with this version of Shirou, whom he referred to as one of the manga's protagonists due to the focus he gave him during the flashbacks about his past; Similar to the original visual novel, Hiroyama wanted to make Shirou select a route during his flashback chapters as he embarks on a quest to protect his sister, Miyu, when fighting against Shinji. The film adapts volumes 7 and 8 of 3rei!. Hiroyama worked with the anime staff and stated that while different areas from the original story were changed, the film was faithful to the original version. Nevertheless, he refrained from revealing more about the movie to the fans. Director Shin Oonuma worked on the movie with the idea of focusing on character actions while also giving full attention to its fight scenes in order to make them highly appealing to the viewers. Shirou Emiya's actor Noriaki Sugiyama described the film as a darker take on the magical girl genre previously explored in the Illya series. Sugiyama said that the idea of Shirou's story being explored in a film rather than a television series sounded interesting. He added \"Shirou is a philanthropist in any world.

When asked about his favorite scene from the film, Sugiyama referred to the final scene due to Shirou's appealing display of characterization as shown by the impact of Shirou's final line to Miyu. Hiroyama felt that Shirou's voice contains in this film a bigger sense of security compared to his manga. The film uses the theme songs \"kaleidoscope\" and by ChouCho. ChouCho made two songs that focused on the relationship between Shirou and Miyu, who are the center of the plot, describing it as heartwarming due to the close bond the siblings have. The song \"Kaleidoscope\" primarily focuses on Shirou's point of view when first meeting Miyu, and she becomes one of the most important people he has ever met. However, due to the film's plot, the lyrics were written to show a darker tone in regard to the development of what happens to the two siblings. While not being a song about Shirou, ChouCho states that by listening to it, viewers will find a bigger standing to the character.

Hiroyama responded to this promotion enthusiastically. Promoting the film, the group \"Cure Maid Cafe\" made a store between August and September 2017, featuring items based on the characters featured in the film. Another promotion involved ramen by Moukotanmen Nakamoto inspired by the film Hiyashi Prism Ramen. The film was released in Japan on home media releases on January 31, 2018. The special exhibition was around that time where the voice actors made autographs to the fans. The special editions of the home media releases include an illustration of Shirou by Hiroyama as well as a short where Shirou and Sakura discuss the changes the film had in comparison to the original printed version. The original soundtrack was released on August 26, 2017. The film was released in English regions on July 14, 2020 as Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya: Vow in the Snow.

In Catholic Digest'''s last years in print the number of issues were decreased, and starting in 2019 there were only eight issues per year. It ceased publication after the Summer 2020 issue. Overview During the 1930s and 40s the magazine published several articles on combating racism and prejudice. In the December 1944 issue Archbishop Francis J. Spellman wrote “No true American will nurture, promote, or incite anti-Semitic, anti-Negro, anti-Catholic, anti-any group of fellow law-abiding American citizens.” The magazine also printed stories on the importance of faith and a positive attitude in gaining strength during illness. The July 1961 issue contained “What My Illness Taught Me,” written by President John F. Kennedy. Many columns appeared over the years. In May 1956 a reader wrote to Catholic Digest with a question about the Catholic faith. That letter was the start of What Would You Like to Know About the Church, which answered questions sent in by readers. The name was later changed to Ask Father and the column appeared until the magazine's demise. In November 1987 the first Patrick's Corner appeared. Sean Patrick reminisced about growing up Catholic in Cleveland, Ohio, during the 1940s and 50s. The last Patrick's Corner was published in the Summer 2019 issue. Several long-running columns lasted through the final issue. Perfect Assist told of people who helped those in need. The name was changed to Love Your Neighbor in March 2002. Daily Inspiration provided a short inspirational quote for each day of the month. Last Word was a two-page personal-experience essay. The first page was on the last page of the magazine, and the second on the next-to-last page. During Catholic Digests final years, from the May 2019 issue through the June/July/August 2020 issue — the magazine averaged 74 pages of content. Publication history FoundingCatholic Digest, originally titled The Catholic Book and Magazine Digest, was founded by Fr. Louis A. Gales, the assistant pastor of St. Agnes Church in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Gales had founded the Catechetical Guild, a company that published catechetical materials, and he wanted to publish a Catholic magazine modeled after Reader's Digest. He sent postcards to the 2,000 names on the Catechetical Guild mailing list, telling about his idea, and asking them to subscribe. Saint Paul's Archbishop John Gregory Murray provided Gales with a loan of one thousand dollars, though he felt the magazine would fail. The archbishop also allowed Gales to use a one-room office in the Chancery basement. The office room contained the building's heating plant. Gales hired Nick Tschida, a high school student from St. Agnes Church, because Tschida could type and drive a car. Tschida would continue to work at Catholic Digest for 66 years. Gales asked a fellow Saint Paul priest, Fr. Paul Bussard to edit the magazine. The first issue was dated November 1936, and had a print run of 13,000 copies. It had an orange paper cover, 64 pages, and no illustrations or advertisements. Previously printed religious articles were condensed to one or two pages, which made it easy for",

Original articles began being purchased and, though Catholic Digest continued to be based in Saint Paul, an additional office was opened in New York City. By 1948 the size had increased to 128 pages, and in 1961 it was up to 144 pages. The May 1949 issue was the first to have a picture on the cover, and in the 1950s special paintings were commissioned for the covers. In 1947 the magazine reported 300,000 subscribers, and 850,000 subscribers in 1957. Change of ownership From 1936 until 1964 Catholic Digest was owned by founder Fr. Louis A. Gales and Fr. Paul Bussard, who was the first editor, and later took on the financial management of the publication. Bussard did not keep accurate financial records, and often carried out unwise financial transactions, such as lending money from the magazine's profits without a written agreement regarding repayment. In 1962 Leo Binz was named the new archbishop of St. Paul and Minnesota, and he ordered a thorough audit of Catholic Digest's finances. Archbishop Binz made an interpretation of church law and declared that the two priests could no longer own the magazine. In 1964 Catholic Digest was sold to the University of St. Thomas. In December 2001, the French Roman Catholic media group Bayard, Inc. purchased the magazine. In late 2011, Bayard closed down another of its publications, Faith & Family, moving its editor, Danielle Bean, over to Catholic Digest, which they rebooted with a new focus on faith and family.

He was one of the closest advisors to Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram. In his early 20s Sang began to write regularly on political and international subjects and became a daily commentator for the national radio station. He became famous thanks to his radio show Mr. Mun and Mr. Kong and soon was appointed the head of the radio and newspaper sections of the Thai Government Publicity Department. In 1938, shortly after becoming prime minister, Phibunsongkhram named Sang the official government spokesman and put him in charge of all government propaganda. It was in this capacity that when Thailand had to declare war against the Allies in World War II, Sang had the distinction of reading the formal declaration of war over the radio on January 25, 1942. When the war ended the Allies wanted to prosecute Sang, along with Phibunsongkhram and a few others, for war crimes. However, as Phibunsongkhram had during the war refused Japanese pressure to arrest alleged resistance leaders and had allegedly looked the other way as Pridi Banomyong, the leader of the Free Thai Movement, developed contacts with the Allies during the war, and with public opinion favourable to all those arrested by the Allies, the Thai Supreme Court ruled that they could not be prosecuted under a war crime statute imposing the death sentence that had been enacted after the end of the war, and ordered their release. In 1947 Phibun became prime minister once again and invited Sang to join the cabinet. However Sang refused, preferring to remain Phibun's confidant and advisor.

In 1956, with Phibunsongkhram's government openly pro-western and anti-Chinese, Sang and Phibun devised a strategy to establish a backdoor informal communication channel with the Chinese government. They agreed to send two of Sang's children to be brought up under the auspices of Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai as his wards. A daughter aged eight and a son aged twelve secretly travelled through Burma to Beijing. Unfortunately for the children, a sudden change of government resulting from a coup, meant that their father was arrested for his pro-Beijing policies and his newspaper articles about China. Sang's arrest meant loss of contact with Premier Zhou Enlai and consequently with his children. Sang's daughter, Sirin Phathanothai, would later write a book, The Dragon's Pearl, about her experiences growing up among China's elite. Following the death in 1963 of dictator Sarit Thanarat (whose government arrested Sang), the political climate eased somewhat in Thailand. It was at this time that Sang, after being under arrest for seven years, was finally brought to trial before a military tribunal. The trial, open to the public and widely covered by Thai media at the time, was the first of many trials for the intellectuals, writers, journalists, lawyers, and university professors who had been arrested without any formal charges and sent to jail for several years under Sarit's military dictatorship. Sang was specifically accused of publishing subversive and seditious articles on China from October 1956 to September 1958. Sang conducted his own defense and shortly after cross-examining the prosecution witnesses, the military judges dismissed all charges.

Factors Sex Clinical studies by the journal of Psychosomatic Medicine found that \"men had higher pain thresholds and tolerances and lower pain ratings than women\" when they are exposed to cold pressor pain. The study asked participants to submerge their hands in ice water (the cold pressor pain procedure) and told members of the experimental group (as opposed to the control group) that they would be compensated financially for keeping their hand submerged. Suggested explanations for this difference include, \"men are more motivated to tolerate and suppress expressions of pain because of the masculine gender role, whereas the feminine gender role encourages pain expression and produces lower motivation to tolerate pain among women.\" Passive or active support A similar study published in the same books focused on the effects of having individuals perform the ice water procedure if they are accompanied by another participant. Their results revealed, \"Participants in the active support and passive support conditions reported less pain than participants in the alone and interaction conditions, regardless of whether they were paired with a friend or stranger. These data suggest that the presence of an individual who provides passive or active support reduces experimental pain.\" Age Age and pain tolerance are relevant especially in the elderly because if their pain is detected too late, they run the risk of greater injury or delayed treatment of disease. However, current knowledge shows that pain tolerance does not show substantial change with age. Only pain threshold shows an effect: it increases with age. Ethnicity Although it is inconclusive whether pain tolerance differs by ethnicity, some studies have shown that non-Hispanic whites possess higher heat and cold pain tolerance when compared to African Americans and Hispanics. Psychological factors Patients with chronic mood disorders show an increased sensitivity to pain. This is not surprising because many of the brain pathways involved in depression are also involved in pain. These disorders weaken the cognitive aspect of pain and thus lower pain tolerance. These effects are worse in unipolar compared to bipolar disorders, although both perceive pain significantly worse than people without a mood disorder. The lowest pain tolerance was seen in participants that were currently experiencing a major depressive episode. Lower pain tolerance associated with depressive symptoms can increase thoughts of suicide. Hand dominancy, or handedness One way to measure pain is to have participants place their hand in ice cold water. Their pain tolerance can then be measured based on how long they are able to keep their hand submerged before taking it out. One study used this technique to compare pain tolerance in dominant and non-dominant hands. One finding was that dominant hands showed a higher pain tolerance than non-dominant hands. Right-handers could withstand pain longer in their right hand than their left hand while the opposite was true for left-handers.

It was once thought that because infants’ nociceptive pathways in the brain were still developing, they could not feel pain. However, infants can feel pain and infant surgeries providing early pain experiences can alter the brain’s tolerance for pain later so by increasing number of A fibers and C fibers—two types of pain receptors—located in the area where injury occurred and by reducing pain tolerance in the areas where incision has occurred. This reduction in pain tolerance is seen in male rats even when they are adolescents. In those rats, the area of their brain where an incision was made as an infant remains hypersensitive to pain thereafter. This effect was not seen as prominently in female rats. Association and disassociation Association and disassociation are two cognitive strategies have been found to increase pain tolerance. Conditioning It is widely believed that regular exposure to painful stimuli will increase pain tolerance, increasing the ability of the individual to handle pain by becoming more conditioned to it. However, in some cases, there is evidence to support the theory that greater exposure to pain will result in more painful future exposures. Repeated exposure bombards pain synapses with repetitive input, increasing their responsiveness to later stimuli, through a process similar to learning. Therefore, although the individual may learn cognitive methods of coping with pain, such methods may not be sufficient to cope with the boosted response to future painful stimuli. A mouse model study on the role of protein kinase C gamma (PRKCG) in pain sensitization found that mice lacking the protein also lacked the neuropathic pain sensitization seen in normal animals.

Its syntax is very close to Python and it makes it easy for Python programmers to write non-Python supporting code for interfacing modules in a language which is as close to Python as possible. Python itself only provides a C API to write extension modules, which allows writing of functions and datatypes in C. These can then be accessed from Python. It is possible to wrap the functions and datatypes of existing C libraries as Python objects and therefore make them available to Python. Pyrex allows the user to write extension modules in a Python-like language which may directly access the external C code. The similarity of Pyrex's syntax to Python's makes it easy to write Python modules, but there are some functional limitations. The programmer must specify the name of C-header files, enumerations, datatypes and functions needing to be accessed in the module, then they can be used as if they were Python objects. The Pyrex compiler will generate the necessary glue code automatically and compile the Pyrex code into a working Python module. There are tools like SWIG or Python's foreign function library ctypes which can be used for this task without requiring much additional code, but this is limited to making an external library available in Python code If adjustments to the API are needed, glue code must again be written manually.

He was the son of Titus Veturius Geminus Cicurinus, consul in 494 BC. Biography Consulship In 462 BC, he became consul with Lucius Lucretius Tricipitinus. The Romans recovered from a severe epidemic that occurred the year before and had taken the two consuls Publius Servilius Priscus Structus and Lucius Aebutius Helva, the augurs Titus Verginius Tricostus Rutilus and Manius Valerius Volusus Maximus, and the Curio Maximus Servius Sulpicius Camerinus Cornutus. Before the end of his consulship, a series of interreges were nominated in order to organize new elections. This they conducted during the term of the interrex, Publius Valerius Publicola in 462 BC. War against the Aequi and the Volsci The Aequi and Volsci attempted to take advantage of the consequences of the epidemic and attacked the territories of Rome and the Hernici. Geminus easily put the Volsci to flight while Lucius Lucretius inflicted a serious defeat against the pillagers, recovering the loot that they had taken from Roman territory. For these victories, Lucius Lucretius was given the honor of celebrating a triumph and Geminus was given an Ovation. The rogatio Terentilia When the consuls were absent from Rome, leading their armies in campaign against the Aequi and the Volsci, Terentilius, tribune of the plebs, proposed a law creating a special commission charged with regulating consular power. Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, named praefectus urbi in absence of the consuls, opposed drafting the law and deferred the vote until the return of the consuls. Decemvirate In 451 BC, he was probably among the First Decemvirate - who wrote the first legal documents of Rome, the Law of the Twelve Tables, and who, according to tradition, governed Rome for one year with moderation. However, it is not certain that he was a decemvir as ancient authors disagree on his name. The Fasti Capitolini and Diodorus Siculus give the praenomen of Spurius, Livy that of Lucius, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus that of Titus While many of the decemvirs were also consuls, only Titus Veturius Geminus Cicurinus and his (presumed) cousin Gaius Veturius Cicurinus match well with their filiations given by the Fasti Capitolini.

Although native Chinese antiquarianism developed some rigorous methods of unearthing, studying, and cataloging ancient artifacts, the field of archaeology in China never developed into a branch of study outside of Chinese historiography. Native Chinese antiquarian studies waned after the Song period but were revived during the Qing dynasty (1644-1912). Rigorous standards of modern Chinese archaeology were first developed at the turn of the 20th century by Chinese archaeologists educated in the West and in the early Republic of China (1912–1949). History Archaeology in China is divided into two stages, namely traditional epigraphy and modern archaeology. Traditional Epigraphy During the Song dynasty (960–1279), the Chinese gentry's antiquarian pursuits of art collecting, scholar-officials retrieved ancient relics from archaeological sites in order to revive the use of ancient vessels in ceremonies of state ritual. Scholar-officials claimed to have discovered ancient bronze vessels that were created as far back as the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BCE), which bore the written characters of the Shang era. Some attempted to recreate these bronze vessels by using imagination alone, not by observing tangible evidence of relics, a practice criticized by Shen Kuo in his Dream Pool Essays published in 1088. He also objected to the idea of his peers that ancient relics were created by famous \"sages\" in lore or the ancient aristocratic class, rightfully observing the discovered handicrafts and ancient vessels as the work of artisans and commoners from previous eras. Shen also disapproved of his peers' pursuit of archaeology simply to enhance state ritual, since he not only took an interdisciplinary approach with the study of archaeology, but he also emphasized the study of functionality and investigating what was the ancient relics' original processes of manufacture. Shen used ancient texts and existing models of armillary spheres to create one based on ancient standards and experimented with ancient musical measures, making the suggestion to hang an ancient bell by a hollow handle. The scholar Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) analyzed alleged ancient artifacts bearing archaic inscriptions in bronze and stone, which he preserved in a collection of some 400 rubbings; Patricia Ebrey writes that he pioneered early ideas in epigraphy.

Another catalogue was the Chong xiu Xuanhe bogutu (重修宣和博古圖) or \"Revised Illustrated Catalogue of Xuanhe Profoundly Learned Antiquity\" (compiled from 1111 to 1125), commissioned by Emperor Huizong of Song (r. 1100 – 1125), and also featured illustrations of some 840 vessels and rubbings. This catalogue was criticized by Hong Mai (洪迈) (1123–1202), who found that descriptions of certain ancient vessels dating to the Han Dynasty were incorrect when he compared them to actual Han Dynasty specimens he obtained for study. Song scholars established a formal system of dating these artifacts by examining their inscriptions, decorative motif styles, and physical shapes. Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129) stressed the importance of utilizing ancient inscriptions to correct discrepancies and errors in later texts discussing ancient events, such as with dates, geographical locations of historical events, genealogies, and official titles. Bruce G. Trigger writes that interests in antiquarian studies of ancient inscriptions and artifacts waned after the Song Dynasty, but were revived by early Qing dynasty (1644–1912) scholars such as Gu Yanwu (1613–1682) and Yan Ruoju (1636–1704). Craig Clunas also states that epigraphic studies weren't revived until the Qing Dynasty, but that printed copies of the Chong xiu Xuanhe bogutu were widely circulated in the 16th century during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Trigger asserts that archaeology as a discipline of its own never developed in China until adoption of Western methods in modern times, and was always considered a branch of historiography instead. Modern Archaeology Modern archaeology is the transformation and evolution of ancient Chinese archaeology, that is, traditional epigraphy to modern archaeology, and its characteristics are the collision and convergence of Eastern and Western academics. At the beginning of the 20th century, the \"Yigupai\" emerged, and the historians were divided in the study of ancient Chinese history. Fu Sinian advocated using archaeology to solve this problem, and wanted to verify historical materials through underground cultural relics. He made great contributions to the excavation of Yin Ruins. Under the protection of Fu Sinian, the archaeological team of the Shiyu Institute conducted a total of 13 Yin Ruins excavation work. The continuous archaeology of the Yin Ruins cultivated the first generation of archaeologists in China who upheld modern scientific standards. The advancement of archaeology in mainstream Chinese science was developed by a group of leading archaeologists represented by Li Ji（1896-1979), Liang Siyo（1904-1954), and Xia Nai（1910-1985), who received strict anthropological and archaeological training in the West. The establishment of the archaeological group of the Institute of History and Linguistics of the Academia Sinica became a national-level institution specializing in archaeology at that time. The establishment of the Geological Survey Institute in 1916 was a sign of the scientific research carried out by Chinese academic institutions in modern times. Under the leadership of the founder, Director Ding Wenjiang, geology has made great achievements in China, hired many foreign experts, trained a group of professional local field workers, disseminated a large amount",

In 1926, Li Ji excavated at the site of Xiyin Village, Xia County, Shanxi Province, which was the first field excavation conducted by Chinese scholars. In 1928, the archaeological group of the Shiyu Institute excavated the ruins of Yinxu. Wang Guowei once proposed a \"dual evidence method\" that combines written documents and underground relics to study history. The \"dual evidence method\" not only promotes the new development of historical research, but also lays a foundation for archaeological research theoretically and methodically.

Level of consciousness (LOC) is a measurement of a person's arousability and responsiveness to stimuli from the environment. A mildly depressed level of consciousness or alertness may be classed as lethargy; someone in this state can be aroused with little difficulty. People who are obtunded have a more depressed level of consciousness and cannot be fully aroused. Those who are not able to be aroused from a sleep-like state are said to be stuporous. Coma is the inability to make any purposeful response. Scales such as the Glasgow coma scale have been designed to measure the level of consciousness. An",

        "prompt": "level of consciousness can result from a variety of factors, including alterations in the chemical environment of the brain (e.g. exposure to poisons or intoxicants), insufficient oxygen or blood flow in the brain, and excessive pressure within the skull. Prolonged unconsciousness is understood to be a sign of a medical emergency. A deficit in the level of consciousness suggests that both of the cerebral hemispheres or the reticular activating system have been injured. A decreased level of consciousness correlates to increased morbidity (sickness) and mortality (death). Thus it is a valuable measure of a patient's medical and neurological status. In fact, some sources consider level of consciousness to be one of the vital signs. Definition Scales and terms to classify the levels of consciousness differ, but in general, reduction in response to stimuli indicates an altered level of consciousness: Altered level of consciousness is sometimes described as altered sensorium. Glasgow Coma Scale The most commonly used tool for measuring LOC objectively is the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). It has come into almost universal use for assessing people with brain injury, or an altered level of consciousness. Verbal, motor, and eye-opening responses to stimuli are measured, scored, and added into a final score on a scale of 3–15, with a lower score being a more decreased level of consciousness. Others The AVPU scale is another means of measuring LOC: people are assessed to determine whether they are alert, responsive to verbal stimuli, responsive to painful stimuli, or unresponsive. To determine responsiveness to voice, a caregiver speaks to, or, failing that, yells at the person. Responsiveness to pain is determined with a mild painful stimulus such as a pinch; moaning or withdrawal from the stimulus is considered a response to pain. The ACDU scale, like AVPU, is easier to use than the GCS and produces similarly accurate results. Using ACDU, a patient is assessed for alertness, confusion, drowsiness, and unresponsiveness. The Grady Coma Scale classes people on a scale of I to V along a scale of confusion, stupor, deep stupor, abnormal posturing, and coma. Pathophysiology Although the neural science behind alertness, wakefulness, and arousal are not fully known, the reticular formation is known to play a role in these. The ascending reticular activating system is a postulated group of neural connections that receives sensory input and projects to the cerebral cortex through the midbrain and thalamus from the reticular formation. Since this system is thought to modulate wakefulness and sleep, interference with it, such as injury, illness, or metabolic disturbances, could alter the level of consciousness. Normally, stupor and coma are produced by interference with the brain stem, such as can be caused by a lesion or indirect effects, such as brain herniation. Mass lesions in the brain stem normally cause coma due to their effects on the reticular formation. Mass lesions that occur above the tentorium cerebelli normally do not significantly alter the level of consciousness unless they are very large or affect both cerebral hemispheres.

        "prompt": "to questions and reactions to stimuli such as touch and pain are noted. Reflexes, such as the cough and gag reflexes, are also means of judging LOC. Once the level of consciousness is determined, clinicians seek clues for the cause of any alteration. Usually the first tests in the ER are pulse oximetry to determine if there is hypoxia, serum glucose levels to rule out hypoglycemia. A urine drug screen may be sent. A CT head is very important to obtain to rule out bleed. In cases where meningitis is suspected, a lumbar puncture must be performed. A serum TSH is an important test to order. In select groups consider vitamin B12 levels. Checking serum ammonia is particularly advised in neonatal coma to discern inborn errors of metabolism. Differential diagnosis A lowered level of consciousness indicate a deficit in brain function. Level of consciousness can be lowered when the brain receives insufficient oxygen (as occurs in hypoxia); insufficient blood (as occurs in shock, in children for example due to intussusception); or has an alteration in the brain's chemistry. Metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus and uremia can alter consciousness. Hypo- or hypernatremia (decreased and elevated levels of sodium, respectively) as well as dehydration can also produce an altered LOC. A pH outside of the range the brain can tolerate will also alter LOC. Exposure to drugs (e.g. alcohol) or toxins may also lower LOC, as may a core temperature that is too high or too low (hyperthermia or hypothermia). Increases in intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull) can also cause altered LOC. It can result from traumatic brain injury such as concussion. Stroke and intracranial hemorrhage are other causes. Infections of the central nervous system may also be associated with decreased LOC; for example, an altered LOC is the most common symptom of encephalitis. Neoplasms within the intracranial cavity can also affect consciousness, as can epilepsy and post-seizure states. A decreased LOC can also result from a combination of factors. A concussion, which is a mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) may result in decreased LOC. Treatment Treatment depends on the degree of decrease in consciousness and its underlying cause Initial treatment often involves the administration of dextrose if the blood sugar is low as well as the administration of oxygen, naloxone and thiamine.

Fed up, Yu Ping asks his secretary, Yang Duo, to find a nanny that meets his requirements. Having lost all their wealth when their mother died and being abandoned by their father after racking up heavy debts, Yang Duo cannot ignore the fact that she needs the money and recommends her younger sister Yang Guo (Ella Chen) for the job, assuring Yu Ping that her tomboyish sister will not fall in love with him by lying that she is a lesbian. But the tables are turned on Yu Ping as he ends up falling in love with his new nanny.

The Moderne style building was constructed in part with Works Progress Administration funds and is the third building to serve as the Burnet County Courthouse. Lewis Milton Wirtz of Columbus designed the structure. It was completed August 1, 1937 at a cost of approximately $135,000. The first Burnet County Courthouse was a one-story frame building containing a courtroom, a jail and offices. In 1874, the courthouse, located on the southwestern corner of the present courthouse square, burned down. The second courthouse was constructed of limestone in 1875 and also housed a jail. When the 1875 courthouse fell into disrepair, the county decided to build a new courthouse. The need for a new courthouse had long been evident in Burnett County, with various county offices having to be housed outside the courthouse due to space constraints. The need for a new courthouse came to the forefront in 1934. In June of that year, a report of the Burnet County Grand Jury found that \"the Tax Assessor and the Tax Collector are without a vault to protect the records of their offices,\" and noted that a fire could destroy valuable records. The grand jury recommended, since the two offices were set to be combined in to one in 1935, moving a men's restroom in the courthouse to accommodate the need for larger office space. In December of that year, Burnet Mayor W.C. Galloway proposed using government match-funding programs to construct a new courthouse. The last week of November, 1935, the Works Progress Administration announced that $74,000 had been allocated for the construction of a new courthouse and jail repairs in Burnett County. Because the courthouse was proposed as a Works Project Administration project, the local government of Burnet County was required to bear a portion of the costs. The county was required to come up with $74,000 to match with federal funds of $61,000. In order to raise these funds, the Burnet County Commissioners Court voted to hold an election to allow voters to decide if the county should sell bonds to come up with its portion of the funds necessary for the courthouse project. It was projected that the additional five-cent maintenance tax required to pay off the bonds would cost a property owner with $1,000 worth of property an additional fifty cents per year in taxes. The Burnett Bulletin editorialized in favor of the bonds. The bond election for voters to approve $74,000 in bonds to be matched with federal funding of $61,000 for a total of $135,000 to build the new courthouse was conducted December 21, 1935. The bond election passed by 81 votes, 401-320. 721 votes were cast. The box for the city of Burnett",

Although Neptune Glacier is not located within the mountain range Planet Heights, the glaciers name derives from the mountain range along with many other nearby glaciers named after planets of the Solar System. There are also other nearby landforms named in association with these glaciers. The glacier was first sighted from the air by Lincoln Ellsworth on November 23, 1935, and roughly mapped from photos obtained on that flight by W.L.G. Joerg. The mouth of the glacier was positioned in 1936 by the British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE).

Producer Although the term \"producer\" was not in circulation at the time Paramor started producing records (the usual term being Artiste and Repertoire Manager, or A&R man), he effectively began this role in 1952 when he became Recording Director for EMI's Columbia Records. As well as being producer for Cliff Richard and the Shadows, he produced records for Ruby Murray, Eddie Calvert, Michael Holliday, Helen Shapiro, Frank Ifield, Frankie Vaughan, the Mudlarks, the Avons, and Ricky Valance, among others. Per The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles, Paramor and George Martin his opposite number at EMI sister label Parlophone jointly held the record for having produced the most UK Number 1 hit singles until Martin produced \"Candle in the Wind 97\" for Sir Elton John, 18 years after Paramor died. This ignores The Beatles' second single \"Please Please Me\", produced by Martin, which was recognised as a number one hit by every other publicly available chart of the time, but not by Record Retailer and therefore not by British Hit Singles, which uses that chart as its source from 1960.

This became his trademark orchestral signature sound, and was featured on Autumn, Amor Amor, In London, In Love Again, Warm and Willing, My Fair Lady, and Moods, among others. Paramor also composed music for films, including Serious Charge (1959), Expresso Bongo (1959), The Young Ones (1961), No My Darling Daughter (1961), The Frightened City (1961), A Pair of Briefs (1962), Two and Two Make Six (1962), The Wild and the Willing (1962), The Fast Lady (1963), Doctor in Distress (1963), Father Came Too!

Schneirla convinced Rosenblatt that the study of animal behavior would broaden his understanding of human behavior and that it was interesting in itself. He began his research on the role of hormones and experience on the sexual behavior of male cats. Supported by Schneirla, he began his doctoral work in 1958 at the American Museum of Natural History study of early learning in kittens. He discovered that kittens could orient to home by 3 to 4 days of age and that they formed nipple attachment preferences by 1 to 2 days of age. This was contrary to learning paradigms of that time, which assumed that animals could not learn at very young ages. In the 1950s, while an assistant professor at the City College of New York, he became a person of interest for the House Un-American Activities Committee, which was conveyed to the City College of New York. Subsequently, his contract was not renewed he went to Rutgers University at Newark where he joined the Institute of Animal Behavior the Institute of Animal Behavior founded by Daniel S. Lehrman who he had been friends with during graduate school. In 1972, he became director of the Institute of Animal Behavior at Rutgers University-Campus at Newark by unanimous vote after the death it founder Daniel S. Lehrman and remained its director for more than 17 years. He served as dean of the Graduate School of Rutgers University-Newark. He also served as editor for Advance in the Study of Behavior for more than 10 years. In 2005, he retired as Daniel S. Lehrman Professor of Psychobiology. After his retirement, he continued to work at the Rutgers University-Campus at Newark until 2012. He was viewed as a successful mentor by those who knew him: Painter As a teenager, Rosenblatt apprenticed in the studio of Ben Wilson under the Works in Progress Administration. Wilson had a major impact on him, Rosenblatt would later say of Wilson \"I saw that he was thoughtful and deeply sincere in his work and that he would be supportive of my becoming a painter.\" He would keep in contact with Wilson for 63 years until Wilson died in 2005. Rosenblatt's painting was influenced not only by Wilson but also by painters such as Georges Braque, Paul Cézanne, and Pablo Picasso. The content of his paintings was influenced by Judaism and Marxism. Many of his paintings were political focusing on war",

For example, in his painting \"Mother and older Child,\" both of his subjective and scientific perspectives of mother-child relationships are expressed, evoking both discomfort and comfort in the viewer. He never became a professional painter, but Rutgers University held a show in the late 1990s for 56 of his paintings. Psychoanalysis and clinical psychologist Rosenblatt met psychoanalyst Max Hertzman while he was a teaching assistant at City College of New York. He was interested in psychoanalysis because he wanted to understand better \"intrapsychic events\" in himself and his clients. He also wanted to find out if psychology as he understood it could be applied to real people, which led him to take a job at the Pediatric Psychiatry Clinic at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. There he diagnosed children with emotional and psychological disorders. He discovered that his formal training in psychology helped him to understand the children he diagnosed. Scientist Rosenblatt's research in developmental psychobiology focused on early neonate learning and maternal behavior. It explored these processes using multiple levels of analysis, using multiple techniques, and from multiple perspectives (i.e., proximal, functional, comparative, and evolutionary). Neonate learning In the 1960s, Rosenblatt experimentally demonstrated that learning in newly born animals occurred earlier than had been thought possible (see Rosenblatt, Turkewitz, and Schneirla, 1969). His early work with kittens showed that early learning in neonates initially involved single sensory modalities such as tactile, thermal, and olfactory sensory modalities. As development proceeded these sensory modalities are integrated and learning becomes multimodal. His early work with kittens demonstrated these developmental processes of early learning and set the stage for a new field of research that focuses on neonatal learning in naturalistic contexts (see Rosenblatt, 1971; Rosenblatt, Turkewitz, and Schneirla, 1969). The discovery of early learning in neonates was, according to Rosenblatt, serendipitous. It occurred while he was studying cats in the 1950s and when he was weighing kittens on a daily basis. He noticed that when he returned the kittens to their home environment (without their mother present), they returned to their home corner faster and faster each day. The kittens' eyes had not yet opened during this time and so they were blind to any visual stimuli. The only way they could find the corner they had been in is by learning the olfactory characteristics of that area in their home environment where they had been nursed (see Rosenblatt, 1983; Rosenblatt, Turkewitz, and Schneirla, 1969). Maternal behavior He did his seminal work on maternal behavior during the late 1960s through the 1970s. This work consisted of two major themes: behavioral transitions in maternal cyclic patterns of behavior and the coupling of mother-offspring behavior during these maternal cycles (Rosenblatt, 1970). His work on maternal behavior, starting in the 1960s, focused primarily on the rat as an animal model. He identified three important phases in maternal cyclic patterns of behavior: the first phase spans conception through most of pregnancy, the second",

        "prompt": "towards the end of pregnancy and continues through birth, and the third is the maintenance phase, which extends from the postpartum phase to weaning. He began his research by describing the phenomena associated with each of these phases of the mother-offspring cyclic patterns of behavior. His studies also determined the role of sensory factors in mother and offspring behavior. He investigated physiological, hormonal, and affective mechanisms and their feedback in maternal and offspring cyclic patterns of behavior (Rosenblatt, 1980). It is because of Rosenblatt's early study of maternal behavior, the coupling of mother-offspring behavior, and his conceptualization of these behavioral processes as occurring in phases that he is often called \"father of mothering\" or \"father of maternal behavior\" within the field of psychobiology. Rosenblatt's 1967 study of the induction of maternal behavior is considered by many in his field to be his most famous study. In that study he showed that the neural basis of parental care is independent of pregnancy and birth. He found that he could induce maternal behavior in virgin female rats during a 6 to 8 day period by continuously exposing them to rat pups. He also found that female rats that were ovariectomized or hypophysectomized could also be induced to exhibit maternal behavior via the continuous exposure to rat pups. Although the hormonal and physiological processes that occur during pregnancy and birth enhance maternal behavior, maternal behavior has an already developed neural basis in the brain. Honors and awards He received several honors and awards during his career. In 1971, he was elected as a fellow of the Animal Behavior Society. In 2004, he was elected as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1986, a volume of the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences was published in honor of Jay S. Rosenblatt for his contributions to the field of animal behavior.

It lies in Bromsgrove District and is situated on the Lickey Ridge, amongst the Lickey Hills, its proximity to countryside and the city makes it a popular commuter area. The civil parish of Lickey and Blackwell has a population of 4,140. The name of Lickey dating back to 1225 is thought to have derived from 'leac' (a clearing) and 'hey' (an enclosed space), including perhaps referring to a clearing in the forest. Various names have included La Lecheye, La Lekeheye, Lechay, Lekhaye. The area forms part of the Lickey Hills Country Park which covers 524 acres. People The Birmingham-born watercolourist Elijah Walton (1832–1880) lived at Beacon Farm in Lickey towards the end of his life, and died there in 1880. The area was populated rapidly from the 1870s onwards by professionals and industrialists such as Herbert Austin, who moved to Lickey Grange in 1910 and lived there until his death in 1941. He is buried in the graveyard of the local church of Holy Trinity. The First World War fighter ace Oliver Bryson was born in Lickey on 18 August 1896. The author Jonathan Coe was born in Lickey in 1961. Today the area has a mainly professional and entrepreneurial population. Landmarks Opposite Holy Trinity Church, Lickey is a drinking trough for horses and drinking fountain for travellers. The Monument, a 60–80 ft tall obelisk, is situated behind the trees bordering the old Birmingham road directly opposite the petrol station in Lickey. The inscription reads \"To commend to imitation the exemplary private virtues of Other Archer 6th Earl of Plymouth\". The Earl had land at Tardebigge, near Lickey. Houses Lickey has some late Victorian houses but there was steady development of housing in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, there has been 'infill' housing. Transport Lickey is served by hourly buses to Bromsgrove, Rubery, Droitwich and Halesowen.

It was one of San Diego's first skyscrapers; when it opened in 1927 it was the tallest building in San Diego. It is San Diego Historical Site # 135 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History The location, 233 A Street on the southwest corner of 3rd Avenue and A Street, was originally the site of a second home and carriage house for Alonzo Horton, the father of Downtown San Diego. The Sisters of St. Joseph purchased the property from Horton in the 1880s and established a girls' school, the Academy of Our Lady of Peace, in the large home, using the carriage house as a convent and offices. The Academy moved to its current location, a larger property in Normal Heights, in 1925. The Horton structures were then razed to build the Medico-Dental Building, which opened in 1927. As its name suggests, the building was designed to house medical and dental offices, with a ground-floor pharmacy and a medical library on the 14th floor. Its purpose was to cluster medical and dental services in one place, improving San Diego's medical scene as well as providing a profitable business venture; a similar business model had succeeded in a dozen cities across the country. The original owners were a group of professional men headed by Charles Lineaweaver. Tenancy was restricted to licensed physicians and dentists; the rule was enforced by a Board of Directors and Officers. As time went on the focus of San Diego's medical community shifted uptown toward Hillcrest, where Mercy Hospital and the UCSD Hospital were located. The building was no longer restricted to doctors and dentists but was used more and more for general office tenants, including at various times government offices, the public defender's office, and the San Diego Chamber of Commerce. During the 1980s the name was changed to the Centre City Building. Description The building is 14 stories high with a foundation that encloses a concrete subterranean basement.

Career Frost was born in Boston in 1843. He left school at age eleven to work on a farm where he had no opportunity to follow his artistic inclinations. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he enlisted and served for more than two years. In 1865 he joined Colonel Franklin L. Pope's division of the Western Union surveying party to British Columbia for which he produced sketches. In 1866 he was assigned to Siberia with the purpose of selecting a route to connect a telegraph line from San Francisco to Moscow (Russian-American telegraph). He exhibited at the San Francisco Art Association in 1874, then studied at the Belgian Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Antwerp, with Nicolas de Keyser from 1874 to 1876, and for the next ten years had a studio in North Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1883 he produced his earliest known White Mountain work. In 1885 he accompanied George Kennan on a second trip to Siberia to record the life of Russian exiles, during which time Frost painted several Siberian scenes. The trip was commissioned by The Century Magazine, and Frost and Kennan took numerous photographs which later were given to the Library of Congress and are now housed in the Library's Prints and Photographs Division. Selections from the George Kennan Collection in Meeting of Frontiers consists of 256 photographs taken in a wide range of locations in Siberia. Frost's drawings, some of which were copied from photographs taken during the trip, were used to illustrate Kennan's book, Siberia and the Exile System. For a good many years, Frost had a summer home in Brownfield, Maine, near the Conway area of New Hampshire. He painted many scenes along the Saco River. He was a member of the Boston Art Club and exhibited there during the years 1896 to 1908. His last known address was Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Name Zariadres () is the Greek transliteration of an Iranian name, attested as ZRYTR (ZRYHR) in the Aramaic engravings in Sevan and Siwnik, and as Zareh in Armenian sources. The name is derived from Old Iranian Zari āθra (\"with golden fire\"). Biography Strabo cites Sophene being taken over by a \"general\" of king Antiochus III by 200 BC, called Zariadres. Following the defeat of Antiochus III by the Romans at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, Zariadres and Artaxias revolted and with Roman consent began to reign as kings under the terms of the Treaty of Apamea in 188 BC—Zariadres over Sophene and Artaxias over Armenia. It is possible that Zariadres (Dsariadres) was the father of Abdissares, although the scant historical records have Abdissares ruling before Zariadres. The name written as Dsariadris might be a Greek corruption of the name Bagdassar. A hypothesis is that king Bagdassar was forced to accept rule by king Antiochus III, but stayed as a Satrap, paying tribute until the Battle of Magnesia allowed him to reassert his independence. Strabo was writing 200 years after these events and may not have been accurate. Over a dozen stone boundary markers have been discovered on the territory of modern Armenia from the time of the reign of Artashes with Aramaic inscriptions, before their discovery the existence of these stones was attested by Moses of Chorene In these inscriptions Artashes claims descent from the Yervanduni (Orontid) Dynasty: King Artaxias, the son of Orontid Zariadres.

The only time it has been played to date was at the 1900 Summer Olympics with only a men's contest, and Great Britain won the gold medal, but the possibility of it being recontested at the Olympics has recently resurfaced. Inclusion Cricket was originally scheduled to be included in the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics, which were held in Athens; cricket would have been the only team sport held at the Games. There were, however, insufficient entries and so no event was held. The event was held at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris four years later but only two countries competed, Great Britain and hosts France. The French team was mostly represented by English expatriates, and it is officially considered a mixed team while the English team was represented by Devon & Somerset Wanderers Cricket Club, so was not nationally selected. It is considered that few of the participants would have been good enough to play first-class cricket — only the British side had experience of eight such games in its side through Somerset's Montagu Toller and Alfred Bowerman. The match was played over two days with both 12-a-side teams batting two innings each and did not attract first-class status. England won the match by 158 runs to win the gold medal. If the French had held out for five more minutes the game would have been declared a draw. Knowledge of the game would have been lost but for the forethought of John Symes, a member of the victorious team, who kept a scorecard in his own writing. A cricket tournament was scheduled for 1904 Summer Olympics held in St. Louis but was eventually cancelled. Possible reintroduction Cricket's governing bodies have, for much of their recent history, been unwilling or reluctant to return to the Olympics. In particular, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), considered cricket's two most powerful national governing bodies, have long been opposed. More recently, the prospect of a return to the Olympics for cricket has become more likely. In March 2017, it was reported that International Cricket Council chief Dave Richardson thought the \"time is right\" for Olympic cricket. It has been reported that the opposition of the BCCI to cricket at the Olympics has softened. The likely format would be Twenty20 cricket, the shortest of the three formats of the game established at international level.

Controversial issues have included the level of racism in Russian football and the discrimination against LGBT people in wider Russian society. Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine also caused calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea and support of separatists in War in Donbas. The then FIFA President Sepp Blatter declined requests for the tournament to be moved. The 2015 allegations and criminal investigations of corruption, including a Swiss inquiry into the bidding process for the 2018 World Cup, intensified the public discussion of the appropriateness of Russia as the World Cup venue. In late May 2015, Russia's president Vladimir Putin said that he viewed the corruption investigations as an attempt by the U.S. to oust Sepp Blatter from his post as punishment for his support of Russia as host for the 2018 World Cup. Allegations of corruption The English FA, which competed against Russia to host the tournament, was not satisfied by the 42 page summary released by FIFA, in November 2014, of the 350 page Garcia Report, which cleared both Russia and Qatar of corruption in the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. FA Chairman Greg Dyke called for a re-investigation of the claims, while his predecessor David Bernstein called on all UEFA nations to boycott the two tournaments. Reinhard Rauball, President of the Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL), called on UEFA to secede from FIFA unless the corruption investigation was released in full. Anatoly Vorobyov said \"We have enough disciplinary measures which are laid out in our regulations. On the other hand, perhaps they need to be used more strictly\". In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".

In March 2014 Blatter declined their request and responded by saying: \"The World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work\". Deployment of troops in Eastern Ukraine Following several reports of direct military involvement of Russian troops in Eastern Ukraine, European diplomats revealed on 29 August 2014 that British Prime Minister David Cameron was working for Russia to be stripped of its hosting of the World Cup, as part of an extended sanctions package. Some days later it was revealed that this was on the list of proposals for extended EU sanctions against Russia. However, no immediate action was taken due to the fact that the proposal was made nearly four years before the tournament. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 In July 2014, after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down, Western leaders blamed Russia and there were again calls for the tournament to be moved. Michael Fuchs, a parliamentarian in the German government, stated his belief that moving the tournament would have more impact than sanctions on Russia. The German FA (DFB) did not comment on the issue, although its Dutch counterpart (KNVB), representing the country with the most victims in the disaster, declared that such discussion should wait until the investigation of the accident. Nick Clegg, the then–Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, also stated his belief that due to the crash Russia should be stripped of the World Cup. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, did not share this idea, but appreciated the concern. Sepp Blatter said that the tournament should be a \"force for good\". Events after Russia winning to host the World Cup Racism After it was announced that Russia would host the 2018 World Cup, Dr Rafał Pankowski, a head of UEFA FARE Monitoring Centre, accused the Russian Football Union of downplaying racist chants in stadiums. In October 2013, after allegedly being racially abused by fans of the Russian club CSKA Moscow, Ivorian footballer Yaya Touré stated that black players might boycott the 2018 World Cup unless Russia tackles racism in football. On 13 July 2014, when the next World Cup was handed to Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin said: \"President Blatter puts a lot of personal effort into addressing social issues, and we hope that the preparations for the World Cup in Russia will also contribute to tasks, such as fighting drugs, racism and other challenges we face today\".

LGBT activism In response to discrimination against LGBT people in the country, a number of petitions have been circulated calling for FIFA to strip Russia of hosting rights. Thousands signed these petitions, including United States senators Mark Kirk and Dan Coats and gay rights activists Greg Louganis, Stephen Fry and George Takei. On 14 June 2018 UK-based activist Peter Tatchell was detained in Moscow by local police while staging a protest against the treatment of Russian LGBTs. Ban on negative news reporting Russia's interior ministry ordered police not to provide negative news to the media during the World Cup and instead report only of solved crime cases to project a more positive image of the country. Russian police was instructed not to publish information about conducted raids or results of investigations into the crimes such as robberies and murders. UK response, reception and the British media UK news media had repeatedly warned English football fans travelling to Russia of potential hooligan violence, anti-British hostility and racist intimidation. English fans who have travelled have said they received a warm welcome after arriving in Russia. The Independent reported that \"Most of the English fans blamed the low attendance for a 2-1 win on what they described as alarmist press stories.\" Also Polish media reported on the friendly reception of Polish fans in Moscow and fears of repeated violence between Polish and Russian fans in Warsaw 2012 have not been met. England's failed attempt to stage the 2018 World Cup The Daily Telegraph reported in June 2017 that the former Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge \"were at a meeting during which a vote-swapping deal between England and South Korea was discussed, according to an official report ... At one point officials discussed the possibility of arranging a meeting with the Queen for one FIFA representative whose vote could have helped England.\" Skripal poisoning and aftermath On 14 March 2018, following the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury in the United Kingdom, the British government announced that all official visits to the World Cup were suspended. No ministers or members of the Royal Family will attend matches or other ceremonies. The participation of the England team would not be affected. On 21 March, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson accused the Russian government of planning to use its hosting of the World Cup for propaganda, comparing it to Nazi Germany's use of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin for such purposes. Contrarily, however, he added that it would be unfair to ban the British football teams from competing.

The FIFA disciplinary committee fined the Mexican Football Federation 10,000 Swiss francs ($10,400) for the homophobic chants. The Mexican Football Federation was earlier sanctioned 12 times including 10 fines for anti-gay slurs during its World Cup qualifying campaign. Mexico striker Javier Hernández posted on Instagram, \"To all Mexican fans in the stadiums, don't shout 'pu--'. Let's not risk another sanction.\" Swiss celebrations against Serbia In Switzerland's 2–1 win over Serbia, Swiss goalscorers Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka both celebrated their goals with the double-headed eagle gesture with their hands. The gesture can be interpreted as a symbol of Albanian nationalism and sometimes as symbol of the Greater Albania irredentist concept, and both Shaqiri and Xhaka are of Kosovar Albanian heritage. Kosovo, the former Serbian province that unilaterally declared independence in 2008, is a partially recognized country claimed by Serbia. Both Kosovar President Hashim Thaçi and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama shared their support for the celebration on social media, while it was called \"a disgrace\" by several Serbian newspapers. FIFA subsequently opened an investigation into the incident on 23 June. While some Serbian supporters booed the players, their general anger after the match was more directed at some debatable referee decisions rather than the goal celebrations.

Croatian celebrations against Russia Croatian goalscorer Domagoj Vida and Croatian team's coaching staff assistant Ognjen Vukojević celebrated Croatia's World Cup victory over Russia by shouting \"Glory to Ukraine!\", a slogan adopted by Ukrainian nationalists. FIFA's disciplinary code prohibits political, nationalist and racist slogans in any form. Vida, celebrating the victory with former Croatian international and current assistant coach, Ivica Olić, was also recorded saying \"Belgrade is on fire!\" in Croatian. However, Serbian media reported \"Belgrade\" refers to the name of a pub in Kyiv that Vida had frequented, not the capital of Serbia, and that the phrase was used to encourage the pub to have a party. Aleksandar Holiga, editor of Croatian website Telesport, has largely downplayed the incident saying \"I don't think Vida understood the full meaning and context of what he was saying. Both of them were just doing it because they are close to Dynamo Kiev. It's something that fans would chant\" and that \"politically, Croatia doesn't have a perfect relationship with Russia, but then who does in the rest of Europe?\" BBC reported that \"Ukrainians accused FIFA of siding with Russia and flooded the football body's Facebook page with declarations of \"Glory to Ukraine\".\" After victory over England on July 11 in an interview to Russia 24 Vida said, speaking Russian, that \"he was mistaken\" and \"apologized to Russian people\".

Group H fair play controversy Japan and Senegal finished Group H with the same number of points, the same goal difference, the same number of goals scored and a 2–2 draw as their head-to-head record.

VAR controversies FIFA officially approved the use of a Video assistant referee (VAR) for the 2018 FIFA World Cup during the FIFA Council meeting on 16 March 2018 in Bogotá. This tournament became the first competition to use VAR in full (at all matches and in all venues). After the introduction of VAR in the 2018 World Cup, FIFA deemed it a success. Nevertheless, the use (or lack of use) of VAR has been criticised. Independent assessments note that while most decisions were made correctly as a result of VAR, some were wrong despite VAR review and some decisions which were called incorrectly were not even reviewed. The Guardian concludes that VAR has been most effective for factual decisions such as offsides and mistaken identities, while subjective decisions such as penalties or the disciplining of players have fared much worse. Lack of clarity and consistency are two main areas of weakness. A problem in consistency at the World Cup 2018 was for example the different rulings in similar game situations, which could be explained by unclear interpretation of VAR rules. For instance, in the game between Portugal and Iran in the group stage, Iran got a penalty kick after a handball by Cedric Soares, while in the game between Nigeria and Argentina, Nigeria did not get this chance after Marcos Rojo headed the ball onto his own arm, even after the referee checked the VAR. Another line of criticism has been targeted at the effectiveness of the system in achieving its goal. In the opinion of Scott Stinson from the National Post, VAR, like any other replay system, fails to correct human error and instead only adds to the controversies because human judgment is still necessary. Lack of transparency is another contentious point, as teams have no way to know which incidents were reviewed by the VAR team. At a press conference held after the group stage, FIFA referees committee chairman Pierluigi Collina showed footage of the decision-making process accompanied with audio of the conversations between VAR officials and the referees. Asked if this audio could be made publicly available, as it is in rugby and cricket, Collina answered enthusiastically but cautioned that it might still be too early. Others have pointed to the game-changing nature of VAR. Initial fears that using the system would lengthen the game considerably have not been confirmed, with every VAR review taking up an average of only 80 seconds. The dramatic increase in the number of penalties awarded at the 2018 World Cup has been attributed to VAR catching fouls which would otherwise",

Of the 169 goals scored in the tournament, 22 were from the spot (with 29 being awarded in total), beating the previous record of 17 set in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Jonathan Liew of The Independent compares the situation to the introduction of the Decision Review System in cricket and notes the changes it had on that sport, and suggests that it might lead to changes of a similar nature in football. Some have also pointed out that only red cards, goals, offsides and mistaken identities can be checked by VAR, while other judgements that might potentially lead to a goal cannot be checked. For example, in the 2018 FIFA World Cup final, Antoine Griezmann fell to the ground after a challenge by Marcelo Brozović. The referee awarded a free kick to France despite Croatia players protesting that Griezmann had dived. The free kick led to an own goal by Mario Mandžukić, accidentally diverting the ball into his own net. Later replays showed that Griezmann was already falling before Brozović made contact with him. Some users on social media called for the use of VAR, but VAR cannot check the incident due to the guidelines set for VAR. Many football fans also accuse VAR of favouring \"big teams\". During a 2–2 draw between Spain and Morocco, a challenge from Gerard Piqué did not result in a red card for the Spanish defender, nor did the referee check VAR on multiple possible penalty calls. Fans also claim that the corner kick that led to Iago Aspas's late equaliser was played on the wrong side. There was an uproar on social media after the Group B games, with many fans claiming that Iran and Morocco have been \"robbed\". Moroccan midfielder Younès Belhanda criticized VAR for only helping \"big teams\" as well. Goalkeeper Munir Mohand Mohamedi said Morocco also felt that Cristiano Ronaldo's winning goal in the second fixture should not be allowed as Pepe appeared to foul a defender. As he left the pitch, Morocco winger Nordin Amrabat also appeared to say that the VAR system was \"bullshit.\" Nigeria players were also furious at Rojo's \"clear handball\" not being called, despite the referee checking VAR. \"I don't understand how that was not a penalty,\" Mikel said. \"It was a clear handball. If you look at this game yesterday against Portugal, this was even worse. He [Rojo] had the ball and it hit his hand and it was open. Maybe the referee didn't want to give a second penalty,\" Mikel said. \"For us, we've seen the replay, it was a clear handball. He looked at the VAR, the ball hit the hand. I asked him for explanation, did the ball hit the hand? He said `Yes.' Why is it not a penalty? He did not know.\" During the World Cup final, Croatia winger Ivan Perišić's arm appeared to make contact with the ball.

Ordinary Russian citizens accused their government and president of trying to hide such information amid the euphoria of the tournament, i.e. to use the event as a cover. Alexei Navalny interpreted this reform as a “robbery of tens of millions of people”.

One Russian fan shown several times in the telecast of the opening match turned out to be a glamour model. Getty Images apologised for publishing a gallery of \"the hottest fans at the World Cup\". There were reports of Russian women and female media personnel being harassed by male fans. A Brazilian reporter was commended for upbraiding a man who attempted to kiss her during a live broadcast. Patrice Evra was accused of patronising fellow player-turned-pundit Eni Aluko after applauding a point made by her during ITV's coverage.

Metal Hammer Liz Scarlett described the song as \"so bad in fact, that it makes us want to have a little cry\", writing, \"Lil Pump has somehow absorbed every single cliché in the alternative scene and bundled them all together in a NSFW song that would make your mother very, very upset.\" Metal Injection compared the song unfavourably to other hip-hop inspired metal acts (and vice versa), including Ho99o9, Ghostmane, Tallah, Tetrarch, and Wargasm. MetalSucks called it the \"worst metal song of the year\", comparing the song unfavourably to T-Pain's cover of \"War Pigs\" by Black Sabbath. Track listing Notes \"Pump Rock x Heavy Metal\" features a transition between songs \"Pump Rock\" and \"Heavy Metal\", which were both previewed by Pump individually On second track \"Pull Up\", American rapper Trippie Redd was meant to be featured, but was not included due to clearance issues.

That was the first lyric piece composed in Cuba that we have information about, and its composer was Manuel de Sequeyra y Arango, Captain of the Havana Infantry Regiment. The piece was really a \"dramatic action\" in the Metastasian style; a brief composition in which the choir participated occasionally. From 1810 to 1832 a lyric company performed several operas in Havana, among which were those called Las cuatro columnas del trono español and El major día de La Habana, and in 1811 another company arrived to that city that included the soprano Mariana Galino, contralto Isalbel Gamborino, tenor Juan Palau and the Italian composer Stefano Cristiani. Cristiani and other Spanish composers, such as Manuel Antonio Cocco and José Serrano, were very active, creating, producing and conducting operas in Havana, between 1815 and 1832. Cristóbal Martínez Corrés was the first Cuban opera composer, but his Works, such as El diablo contrabandista and Don papanero were never premiered and haven't been preserved until the present time. Born in Havana, in 1822, composer and pianist Martínez Corrés established his residence together with his family in France when he was just nine years old; and at a later tame they went to Italy. Due to his premature death, a third opera named Safo, never surpassed an early creative stage. Martínez Corrés died in Genoa, in 1842. Among the operatic composers that worked in Cuba during the first half of the 19th century we can mention the Spanish José María Trespuentes and Narciso Téllez, as well as the Italian Enea Elia. We should also mention two other renowned Italian composers, which arrived at a very young age to Havana to work as instrumental performers during the season of 1846–1847, and stayed in Cuba several years. One of them, Giovanni Battista Bottesini, composed his first opera, named Colón in Cuba, in the Island; and the other composer, Luigi Arditi, also premiered his opera Gulnara in Cuba, only four days after Bottesini's. The North-American pianist and composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk lived in Cuba from 1845 to 1862, and there he developed an important work as performer, conductor and composer. Gottschalk utilized Afro-Cuban elements of style in complex classical forms, such as a Caprice di Bravura based on the Cocoyé theme, as well as an opera titled \"Fiesta campestre Cubana (Cuban countryside feast). About that opera Gottschalk wrote in his memoires: \"Two months later (based on an offer made by the General-in Chief to put at my disposal all the military bands) I had, as I tell you, the idea to offer a great festival, and I came to an arrangement with the Italian Opera conductor, then in possession of the Great Tacón Theater. A contract in which he committed to provide the main soloists, all the choirs, and the entire orchestra, with the purpose to obtain a profit with the result. I set up to work and composed, based on some verses in Spanish written for me by a Havanese poet, an opera in one act titled Fête champêtre Cubaine (Cuban countryside feast).\"",

        "prompt": "is quite probable that Fiesta campestre Cubana would be the first opera that included elements of autochthonous Cuban music, because it is possible to clearly perceive in its music the Habanera-tango rhythm, previously utilized by Gottschalk so many times in other Cuban style pieces. Cristóbal Díaz Ayala says about this subject: \"… \"Escenas Campestres\" presents a challenge: if it is the first Cuban opera or not; while Saumell envisioned for his \"Antonelli\" a text in Italian language, \"Escenas Campestres\" was written in Spanish, and its music has undoubtedly a certain creole flavor. But the critics, even from its time, and later, ignore this fact.\" Gaspar Villate y Montes was born in Havana, in 1851 and since an early age he showed a great musical talent. As a child, he began to study piano with Nicolás Ruiz Espadero and in 1867, when he was just 16 years old, he composed his first opera on a drama by Victor Hugo, titled Angelo, tirano de Padua. A year later, at the beginning of the 1868 war, he travelled to the United States with his family and upon his return to Havana in 1871 he wrote another opera called Las primeras armas de Richelieu. Villate travelled to France with the purpose to continue his music studies in the Paris Conservatory, where he received classes from Francois Bazin, Victorien de Joncieres and Adolphe Danhauser. He composed numerous instrumental pieces such as contradances, habaneras, romances and waltzes, and in 1877 he premiered with great audience acclaim his opera Zilia in Paris, which was presented in Havana in 1881. Since then, Villate focused his efforts mainly in opera and composed pieces such as La Zarina and Baltazar, premiered at La Haya and Teatro Real de Madrid respectively. It is known that he worked on an opera with a Cuban theme called Cristóbal Colón, which manuscript has been lost. Villate died in Paris in 1891, soon after he had started to compose a lyric drama called Lucifer, from which some fragments have been preserved. We should mention Laureano Fuentes Matons, Hubert de Blanck and Ignacio Cervantes among the Cuban opera composers from the 19th century. Laureano Fuentes Matons was born on July 3, 1825, in Santiago de Cuba and studied with Juan París, Hierrezuelo and Casamitjana. He composed numerous orchestral and chamber works, as well as the opera Seila. Hubert de Blanck, Dutch pianist and composer established in Cuba, which founded a famous conservatory named after him, composed three operas titled Patria, Actea and Hicaona. According to Jorge Antonio González, Patria was the first Cuban opera based on the Independence Wars theme. One of the most important Cuban composers, Ignacio Cervantes, wrote the lyric drama Maledetto and the comic opera Los Saltimbanquis, which was premiered in the Albisu theater of Havana, on January 25, 1901. Cervantes began to compose Maledetto in 1895, and was able to complete only two acts before his death in 1905. 1901–1959 At the beginning of the 20th century three composers stand out in regard to operistic production, Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes, José Mauri Esteve",

He began his musical studies at Conservatorio Hubert de Blanck and at a later time took classes from Carlos Anckermann. He received also a Law Degree in 1894. When Sánchez de Fuentes was just 18 years old, he composed the famous Habanera \"Tú\", which became an extraordinary international success. Alejo Carpentier said it was: \"the most famous Habanera\". On October 26, 1898, Sánchez de Fuentes premiered at the Albisu Theater in Havana his first opera called Yumuri, based on the Island's colonization theme. In it, an aborigine princess falls in love with a handsome Spanish conqueror, which abducts her at the wedding ceremony with another indigenous character. At the end, while escaping, both suffer a tragic death during an earthquake. At a later time, Sánchez de Fuentes composed another five operas: El Náufrago (1901), Dolorosa (1910), Doreya (1918), El Caminante (1921) and Kabelia (1942). José Mauri Esteve composed numerous zarzuelas for the Alhambra Theater and one opera in three acts called La Esclava, premiered on June 6, 1921, at the Teatro Nacional; and Bernardo Moncada, born in Trinidad, in 1888, composed the lyrical drama Pasión Criolla, as well as the operas Teresa or El grito de Yara and Amara or Los adoradores del sol. Also during the first half of the 20th century, the renowned composer Amadeo Roldán (1900-1939) wrote a so-called gaelic opera [sic.] in three acts, titled Deirdre, from which he could only complete two acts before his premature death. His contemporary, Alejandro García Caturla composed the opera Manita en el suelo with a script from Alejo Carpentier, based on an Afro-Cuban theme. The best Cuban lyrical singer in the 20th century was the operatic tenor Francisco Fernandez Dominicis (Italian name: Francesco Dominici) (1885-1968). The mezzo-soprano Marta Perez was the best Cuban female lyrical singer in the 20th century (1924-2009). She sang in the famous Theater La Scala in Milan, Italy in 1955. 1960 to present During the second half of the 20th century, the operistic production continued flourishing in Cuba, frequently incorporating modern composition technique, as well as contemporary themes. Natalio Galán, born in Camagüey, in 1919, composed the opera los días llenos on a script by Antón Arrufat, utilizing serial techniques; and his colleague from the Renovación Musical group, Hilario González composed two operas: Las puertas abiertas (1964) and Clausura de un pequeño burgués. Among the members of the new generation of composers that began to produce mainly between the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s, we should mention Roberto Sánchez Ferrer, Héctor Angulo and José Loyola Fernández. Roberto Sánchez Ferrer (born 1927) composed an opera inspired on the biography of the Vietnamese communist guerrilla fighter Nguyễn Văn Trỗi, which was captured in 1963 when he was trying to install an explosive artifact with the purpose to assassinate the US DS Robert Mc Namara.

Héctor Angulo (1932), composed a chamber opera titled Ibeyi Añá, based on an Afro-Cuban story by Lydia Cabrera; and José Loyola Fernández (1941) has an opera with an Afro-Cuban theme called Monzón y el Rey de Koré. One of the most active and outstanding composers of his generation, Sergio Fernández Barroso (also known as Sergio Barroso) (1946), is the author of an opera called La forma del camino, which also possesses the complementary title of s-XIV-69 (which means Siglo XIV – 1969). With an approximate duration of 60 minutes, this piece utilizes as a script a story from the Popol Vuh (the sacred text of the Maya culture) about the mythic brothers Hunahpu and Ixbalanqué. The score includes soloists and a choir of nine mixed voices, accompanied by an instrumental group and an electro-acoustic quadraphonic system. The scene requires a stage elevated over the choir spatial position, which members wear dinner jackets, in opposition to the more casual attire of the soloists. All singers wear Indian masks. Renowned Cuban composer Roberto Valera has recently created an opera titled Cubanacán, based on the ambitious architectural project of the National Art Schools (Cuba), located in the Havana Cubanacán neighborhood; site of the Havana Country Club before the 1959 Cuban Revolution. That project has remained unfinished until present times. Part of a more recent generation, composer Juan Piñera (born 1949) includes in his catalogue two operas: Amor con amor se paga from 1987, which consists of two acts and is based on a text by José Martí; and La taza de café, composed in 1989, with two acts and script by Juan Ramón Amán based on a piece of the same name by Rolando Ferrer. Odaline de La Martínez (born 1949), Cuban composer established in Great Britain, has written an operatic trilogy based on an Afro-Caribbean theme. Also Cuban-American composer Orlando Jacinto García (born 1954) is the author of an opera titled Transcending Time, for soprano, instrumental and vocal chamber ensemble, electro-acoustic media and video, which was premiered in the Zagreb Biennial in Croatia by the ensemble Cantus. Most recently the work of two young Cuban composers stand out, Jorge Martín and Louis Franz Aguirre. Jorge Martín was born in Santiago de Cuba in 1959 and established his residence in the US at a very young age. He studied musical composition at the Yale and Columbia Universities. He has composed three lyric pieces: \"Beast and Superbeast\", a series of four operas in one act each, based on short stories by Saki; Tobermory, opera in one act that obtained first prize in the Fifth Biennial of the National Opera Association (USA), and has been presented in several cities of the United States; and Before Night Falls, an opera based on the famous autobiography of the Cuban novelist, playwright and poet Reinaldo Arenas, renowned dissident from the Fidel Castro government.

The short was released on June 3, 1944. The protagonist is a \"Li'l Sambo\" type blackface character who exhibited common racial stereotypes in speech, intelligence and fear of the supernatural. The African-American weekly newspaper The Pittsburgh Courier objected strongly to the cartoon, especially because it was run in Los Angeles alongside the March of Time short Americans All, on the theme of fighting prejudice and stereotypes. The film press did not acknowledge these concerns. The short is one of the \"Censored Eleven\"' a group of Warner Bros. animated shorts that are withheld from circulation due to their dated racist stereotyping and portrayals. This is also the only Looney Tunes short in the Censored Eleven, as the other shorts are Merrie Melodies. Plot A young African-American boy (drawn in blackface style) carries a sack to a river and laments that he has agreed to drown a cat. While the boy stares at the water, the cat slips out of the sack and fills it with bricks. When the boy says that he can't go through with the task, the hidden cat, pretending to be the boy's conscience, says, \"Go ahead, Sambo, go ahead, boy,\" and reminds him that he has been paid \"four bits\" to do the job. Sambo reluctantly drops the bag in the river rather than return the money.

Hill wrote, \"Basis for the spontaneous protest by the long and patient suffering Negro theater-going public were the many forth-right expressions of condemnation regarding Warner Brothers' animated cartoon Angel Puss. Almost in direct irony was the picture's showing in Los Angeles, in that it was sandwiched between the main feature and March of Time's Americans for All, which theme is directly aimed at the lessening of racisms. It has since been learned that the Warner Brothers had ordered the somewhat considered controversial Americans for All to be shown in each of their theatres throughout the country as a contributory effort towards breaking down the evils of race prejudice. In a further attempt to throw light on the subject of caricatures, March of Time offices here were contacted. A spokesman stated that they had nothing to do with the placing of their film on the same program as Angel Puss or any other such picture. It was admitted, however, that in consideration of the type of cartoon, poor taste was shown in the matter.\" However, this concern was not expressed in the film press, which echoed and celebrated the film's stereotypes. On June 24, Boxoffice said: \"A delectable bit of cartoon animation catches the natural aversion of a Colored boy to any form of supernatural suggestion as represented by a cat that was supposed to be drowned by the boy, but escaped. The cat makes life extremely miserable for the boy by dressing up as a spirit, but comes to an unfortunate end.

An article dated November 23, 1903 in the Kobe Asahi Shimbun debated whether or not it should be opened, and another article dated from 1910 mentioned that some 200 iron artifacts including ten iron swords were excavated in the northwestern part of the tumulus, but it is not clear whether or not this is a different location from this sarcophagus. Since the existing sarcophagus is not located in the center of the posterior circular portion, and there have been many instances of multiple burial facilities in other kofun, this remains a possibility. The tumulus is estimated to have been built around the first half of the 5th century in the middle of the Kofun period, and to be the grave of the kuni no miyatsuko of Harima.

According to the 2011 census, it is the third-largest urban agglomeration in Madhya Pradesh and the country's 38th-largest urban agglomeration. Jabalpur is an important administrative, industrial and business center of Madhya Pradesh. It is the judicial capital of Madhya Pradesh as The Madhya Pradesh High Court along with other important administrative headquarters of India and Madhya Pradesh are located in Jabalpur.

The city is known for the marble rocks on the river Narmada at Bhedaghat. Etymology According to a prevalent theory, Jabalpur was named after a sage named Jabali, who meditated on the banks of the Narmada river. Another theory suggests an Arabic origin of the word since jabal in Arabic means granite boulders or huge boulders, which were common in the region. According to a fringe theory, the name refers to Jauli Pattala, a sub-divisional unit, mentioned in Kalachuri inscriptions. Jauli also refers to the Huna queen of the Kalachuri king, Karna. It was spelled as 'Jubbulpore' during British rule In 2006, the Jabalpur Municipal Corporation renamed the city to Jabalpur. History Mythology describes three Asuras (evil spirits) in the Jabalpur region, who were defeated by the Hindu god Shiva. Tripurasura being the main asura, gave the city its puranic name Tripur Tirth. Tripuri region corresponds to the ancient Chedi Kingdom of Mahabharata times, to which king Shishupala belongs. Ashokan relics dating to 300 BCE have been found in Rupnath, north of the city, indicating the presence of the Mauryan Empire (322 to 185 BCE) in the region. When the empire fell, Jabalpur became a city-state before coming under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty (230 BCE to 220 CE).

The best known Kalachuri ruler was Yuvaraja-Deva I ( 915–945), who married Nohla Devi (a princess of the Chalukya dynasty). One of the Kalachuri ministers, Golok Simha Kayastha, was instrumental in founding the Chausath Yogini Temple near Bhedaghat. His descendants include Bhoj Simha, who was the Dewan to the Gond king Sangram Shah (1491–1543); Dewan Aadhar Singh Kayastha, who was the prime minister to Rani Durgavati (r. 1550–1564), and Beohar Raghuvir Sinha, the last Jagirdar of Jabalpur who reigned until 1947. Gondwana rule Jabalpur was an important centre of power during the rule of the Gond kings of Garha-Mandla. The ruler of Garha-Mandla, Madan Shah, (1138–1157) built a watchtower and a small hilltop fort at Madan Mahal, an area in Jabalpur. In the 1500s, the Gond king, Sangram Shah held Singorgarh fort. Rani Durgawati was a princess of the Chandela Dynasty, who was married to Dalpat Shah of the Gond dynasty. She was well aware of the importance of water conservation and hence she built more than 85 ponds in Jabalpur, mainly Ranital, Haathital, Madhatal and Hanumantal.

This is a sacred place of the tradition of Jainism. Mahavirji also had a Bhattaraka seat which became defunct in 1970. Discovery of the Idol The main temple contains the statue of the lord Mahavira and along with idols of other Tirthankaras. The 'Mulnayak pratima' (main statue) is nearly high and is carved out of sandstone. In this statue lord Mahavira is sitting in padmasana posture. The iconic idol of Lord Mahavira, the principal deity of the pilgrimage temple, was found during an excavation. It was later found to be more than 1000 years old. A Gurjar dairy farmer named Krapa Ram noticed that one of his cows was always dry of milk. When cow belonging used to pour out its milk every day upon a mound near Chandanpur village. It was surprising for the owner of that cow and the villagers. They excavated the mound and found the idol of lord Mahaveer. The villagers dedicated themselves to building a small hut over the idol where the idol was found. The place is now known as devata-ka tilla or chharan chatri. The news of the miracles idol spread and a Jain merchant, Shri Amar Chand Bilala visited the site and realised that it was a Jain idol. The King of Jaipur tried to execute the merchant but was saved by the miracles of the idol. Shri Amar Chand Bilala constructed a vast & magnificent temple here. According to legends, while trying to move the idol on a chariot to the temple constructed a few yards from the excavation site, the chariot did not move. Amar Chand Bilala prayed for the idol to move and the god replied that the chariot will move when Krapa Ram pushes the cart. At the site where the idol was excavated a small shrine chharan chatri with the representation of the footprint of the deity was constructed. The shrine is still managed by the family of Krapa Ram.

The party's only electoral success was one municipal mandate in 2010 in the small community of Grästorp in Västra Götaland in western Sweden. The mandate was lost after it was revealed that their representative, Daniel Höglund, was not registered as a resident, which is a requirement for members of municipal councils in Sweden.

When the party filed an application to the Election Authority of Sweden it became apparent that a newly established socialist group had been registered under the same name only weeks before to block its use. In the 2010 elections the party received 102 votes (2.8%) in the elections to municipal council in Grästorp, giving them one mandate. According to the anti-racist watchdog magazine Expo, this made them the first Neo-Nazi party to win a seat in a Swedish political assembly since the end of World War II. At the second council meeting after the election, the policy for public tenders was to be decided; the initial proposal gave preference to bidders with higher health and safety standards and lower environmental impact. Party of the Swedes representative Daniel Höglund managed to gather support for an additional sentence stating that Swedish labourers and companies should be given preference over foreign bidders, given the potential differences in travel distance. Other representatives later told reporters from the newspaper Expressen that this had appeared innocuous, but when later reflecting upon the consequences they recanted the decision and ensured that his suggestion would not have any influence on tenders. A prerequisite for a mandate in Swedish municipal councils is residence in that municipality. After a few weeks and after the official records were reviewed, it was revealed that Höglund was registered as living in the neighbouring municipality and he was deprived of his seat. Though it had received no votes at all, the party gained another seat in Nykvarn Municipality, when an independent member joined the Party of the Swedes. The councilman had been elected for the National Democrats, who received two members in the election of 2010. The party gained a third councilman in the Mönsterås municipal council when a former representative for the Sweden Democrats joined the party. Two Sweden Democrats defected to the party in Hedemora city council, though one of them soon left the Party of the Swedes as well, reducing the number of active representatives to three.

After winning once as a two-year-old, Light Shift won the Cheshire Oaks on her second appearance as a three-year-old. She then won the Classic Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom, beating the Irish filly Peeping Fawn. Light Shift never won another race, being beaten by Peeping Fawn in the Irish Oaks and the Nassau Stakes and finishing unplaced in the Prix de l'Opéra. Background Light Shift was a bay mare with a white star bred in Kentucky by Flaxman Holdings a breeding company run by the Niarchos family. Light Shift's sire, Kingmambo was a highly successful breeding stallion. His progeny included the British Classic winners Russian Rhythm, King's Best, Henrythenavigator Virginia Waters and Rule of Law as well as major winners in Japan (El Condor Pasa), France (Divine Proportions) and the United States (Lemon Drop Kid). Her dam, Lingerie, failed to win a race but was a daughter of Northern Trick, a mare who won the Prix Vermeille and finished second in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Before Light Shift, Lingerie had produced the Prix Jean de Chaudenay winner Limnos and Shiva, a mare who won four races including the Group One Tattersalls Gold Cup. The filly was trained throughout her career by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stables in Newmarket, Suffolk and was ridden in all of her races by Ted Durcan. Racing career 2006: two-year-old season Light Shift began her career in a six furlong maiden race at Newmarket in June in which she finished second, half a length behind the winner Wid. She then finished third to Princess Taise in a seven furlong maiden at the same course a month later. In September she was moved up in distance to one mile and recorded her first win in yet another Newmarket maiden. Starting the 15/8 favourite, she took the lead inside the final furlong and won by half a length from Sunlight. She ended the season being rated 83 by the Racing Post, suggesting that she was at least thirty pounds below top class. 2007: three-year-old season On her first appearance as a three-year-old, Light Shift ran in a ten furlong race for colts and fillies at Newbury.

Durcan restrained the filly in the early stages before moving up to challenge to leaders in the straight. Light Shift took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and opened up a clear lead before holding off the strong late challenge of the Aidan O'Brien-trained outsider Peeping Fawn to win by half a length. All My Loving was four lengths further back in third. The win gave Henry Cecil his eighth win in the race and his first Classic success for seven years. In the Irish Oaks on 15 July, Light Shift was again matched against Peeping Fawn, who had won the Group One Pretty Polly Stakes in the interim. Light Shift, the 9/4 favourite despite her trainers concerns about the soft ground, raced just behind the leaders before taking the lead in the straight, but was soon overtaken by Peeping Fawn and finished second, beaten three and a half lengths. Three weeks later, Light Shift and Peeping Fawn met for a third time in the Nassau Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood. On this occasion, Light Shift made some progress in the straight, but could never reach the lead and finished third, five lengths behind the Irish filly and three and a half lengths behind the runner-up Mandesha. Following the race, Cecil suggested that the filly would be aimed at the Breeders' Cup. After a break of two months, Light Shift reappeared in the Prix de l'Opéra at Longchamp. She started the 11/4 favourite but finished sixth of the eleven runners behind Satwa Queen. Cecil said that the filly's \"flat\" performance may have been the result of a long and demanding season.

Cast Reception The series was criticised for using the term \"WAG\", although the intention of the show - to focus more on the complexities of the subjects lives than their appearance - was regarded as a strong positive. Commentator Brad Newsome criticised the show as being dull. In describing the first episode, Newsome wrote \"You might have imagined that the lives of Australian WAGs (wives and girlfriends of sportsmen) would be terribly exciting.

The series began on 14 April at Bahrain. Timo Glock was crowned series champion on 30 September after winning the final round at Valencia, with Brazilian Lucas di Grassi finishing second. Season summary The season started in Bahrain. Luca Filippi started the season with win from pole, while Nicolas Lapierre took his first GP2 win in his third season in the sprint race. One of pre-season favourites, Timo Glock finished 2nd in both races. Michael Ammermüller, who was driving for defending teams' champion ART Grand Prix was injured and missed next two races. Next event started with big start crash involving several drivers, including series leader Filippi. Safety car was instantly deployed and majority of the field opted to make their mandatory pit stop. Glock wasn't one of those and he lost his chances to win the race as a result. Bruno Senna took his first GP2 victory in his third race. Glock finally got his first win of the season after three second places in the sprint. At Monaco, only one race was held which was won by Pastor Maldonado who had celebrated a victory in World Series there in the previous year. Glock increased his podium streak to five races after finishing 3rd. Two drivers made their comeback to GP2 in Magny-Cours.

The race was eventually won by a veteran Giorgio Pantano, giving Campos Racing its first victory in GP2. Viso's teammate Javier Villa won the sprint race, becoming youngest ever winner in GP2 at that time (the record was broken a year later by Sébastien Buemi). Glock failed to finish both Silverstone races as well. Zuber won the feature race while Carroll took the sprint, making it nine winners in nine races. More amazingly, they were divided to eight different teams: only iSport International had two drivers who had won a race at this point. Glock rebounded to take feature race victory at his home soil in Nürburgring. Sprint race was won by Villa. Glock was also on pole in Hungaroring but failed to score after mistake during the race. Hungaroring race was won by Carroll who leap-frogged several positions with well-timed pit stop during the safety car, as those who had made their stops already had to use start/finish straight which had a lot of debris on it. Villa was again victorious in sprint race, with Carroll taking 2nd. Despite starting later in the season, he was en route to good position in the championship. At Istanbul, Lucas di Grassi, who had finished in the points in every race except one at that point, took his first victory of the season. Glock won the sprint race, so he eventually got more points than di Grassi while these two were battling for the championship. At Monza, Pantano won the feature race and Glock the sprint. di Grassi failed to get podium after car troubles at the end of the feature race. Pantano, meanwhile, was disqualified in the sprint race after driving several laps with broken front wing. At Spa, Glock stalled at the start and finished the race in 17th position.

Sodium fluorescein is added into the systemic circulation, the retina is illuminated with blue light at a wavelength of 490 nanometers, and an angiogram is obtained by photographing the fluorescent green light that is emitted by the dye. The fluorescein is administered intravenously in intravenous fluorescein angiography (IVFA) and orally in oral fluorescein angiography (OFA). The test is a dye tracing method. The fluorescein dye also reappears in the patient urine, causing the urine to appear darker, and sometimes orange. It can also cause discolouration of the saliva. Fluorescein angiography is one of several health care applications of this dye, all of which have a risk of severe adverse effects. See fluorescein safety in health care applications. Fluorescein angiography does not involve the use of ionizing radiation. Fluorescein angiography was pioneered by German ophthalmologist Achim Wessing, who published his findings in 1969. Equipment Exciter filter: Allows only blue light to illuminate the retina. Depending on the specific filter, the excitation wavelength hitting the retina will be between 465 and 490 nm. Most only allow light through at a wavelength of 490 nm. Barrier filter: Allows only yellow-green light (from the fluorescence) to reach the camera. Both filters are interference bandpass filters, which means they block out all light except that at a specific wavelength.",

Fundus camera, either digital or with camera body containing black and white, or slide positive film. Technique Baseline color and black and white red-free filtered images are taken prior to injection. The black and white images are filtered red-free (a green filter) to increase contrast and often gives a better image of the fundus than the color image. A 6-second bolus injection of 2-5 cc of sodium fluorescein into a vein in the arm or hand A series of black-and-white or digital photographs are taken of the retina before and after the fluorescein reaches the retinal circulation (approximately 10 seconds after injection). The early images allow for the recognition of autofluorescence of the retinal tissues. Photos are taken approximately once every second for about 20 seconds, then less often. A delayed image is obtained at 5 and 10 minutes. Some doctors like to see a 15-minute image as well. A filter is placed in the camera so only the fluorescent, yellow-green light (530 nm) is recorded. The camera may however pick up signals from pseudofluorescence or autofluorescence. In pseudofluorescence, non-fluorescent light is imaged. This occurs when blue light reflected from the retina passes through the filter. This is generally a problem with older filters, and annual replacement of these filters is recommended. In autofluorescence, fluorescence from the eye occurs without injection of the dye. This may be seen with optic nerve head drusen, astrocytic hamartoma, or calcific scarring. Black-and-white photos give better contrast than color photos, which aren't necessary because the filter transmits only one color of light. Normal circulatory filling times are approximate 0 seconds – injection of fluorescein 9.5 sec – posterior ciliary arteries 10 sec – choroidal flush (or \"pre-arterial phase\") 10–12 sec – retinal arterial stage 13 sec – capillary transition stage 14–15 sec – early venous stage (or \"laminar stage\", \"arterial-venous stage\") 16–17 sec – venous stage 18–20 sec – late venous stage 5 minutes – late staining Fluorescein enters the ocular circulation from the internal carotid artery via the ophthalmic artery. The ophthalmic artery supplies the choroid via the short posterior ciliary arteries and the retina via the central retinal artery, but the route to the choroid is typically less circuitous than the route to the retina. This accounts for the short delay between the \"choroidal flush\" and retinal filling. Pathologic findings Pathologic changes are recognized by the detection of either hyperfluorescence or hypofluorescence. Causes of hyperfluorescence: window/transmission (filling) defects leaking defects (i.e. capillary leakage, aneurysm, neovascularization) pooling defects staining abnormal vasculature Causes of hypofluorescence: blocking defect (i.e. blood) filling defect (capillary nonperfusion/blockage) Fluorescein angiography is used by physicians specializing in the treatment of eye diseases (ophthalmologists) to evaluate the vasculature of the retina, choroid, optic disc, and iris. Among the common groups of ophthalmologic disease, fluorescein angiography can detect diabetic retinopathy (neovascularization), vein occlusions, retinal artery occlusions, edema of the optic disc, and tumors.

During his forty-seven years in the aviation industry, he was responsible for the design and development of nearly twenty commercial and military airplanes. Verville is known for designing flying boats, military racing airplanes (such as the record breaking Verville-Sperry R-3), and a series of commercial cabin airplanes. His planes were awarded with the Pulitzer Speed Classic Trophy in 1920 and 1924. Verville was a founder of three aeronautical companies, the General Aeroplane Company, Verville Aircraft Company, and the Buhl Aircraft Company. He worked for General Billy Mitchell during his service at the United States Army Air Service from 1918 to 1925. From 1937 to 1945, he worked as a consultant for companies such as Douglas Aircraft, Curtiss-Wright, Snead Aircraft, and Drexel Aviation. Verville spent the next sixteen years in the U.S. federal government, primarily in the Bureau of Aeronautics, before retiring in 1961. Verville received many honors and awards, including a selection as a fellow of the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in 1962. An airmail stamp was issued in 1985 by the US Postal Service in Verville's honor. In 1991, he was posthumously inducted into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame. Early life and career Verville was born in Atlantic Mine, a small town in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, on November 16, 1890, as the son of Victor Verville and Fabianna Miron. As a child, his mother bought him a Conyne-style box kite from Sears Roebuck, which captured his imagination and started his interest in flight and aviation. Verville also began reading stories about the Wright brothers in newspapers and magazines with great interest. Later he even wrote to the Wrights and Glenn Curtiss and received responses. After graduating from Adams Township High School, Verville took a correspondence course in electrical engineering. He moved to Detroit, Michigan, at the age of twenty, and from 1910 to 1913 he worked in the electrical departments of the Detroit Edison Company, Ford Motor Company, and Hudson Motor Car Company. By 1913, Verville had made his mind up that he wanted to learn to fly. William Edmund Scripps, the editor and owner of The Detroit News, introduced Verville to Glenn Curtiss in July 1913. Curtiss encouraged Verville to apply for his spring 1914 flight school. Instead, Verville went to Hammondsport, New York, in February 1914, where Curtiss Aeroplane Company was located, and told Curtiss he wanted to work as an apprentice in his drafting and engineering shop. Curtiss agreed and this began Verville's aviation career. Verville excelled as",

After applying and being passed over three times for the Curtiss Flying School, Verville went to Curtiss, who responded: \"No, Mr. Verville you don't want to be a pilot. We can get all the pilots we want. What we want are designers. You're [really] a designer and you don't know it.\" While at Curtiss Aeroplane, Verville took an active part in the development of the transatlantic flying boat America (which was a Curtiss H-2) and the Curtiss Jenny of World War I fame. In the fall of 1914, Verville left the company and joined the Aeromarine Plane and Motor Company in New Jersey; shortly thereafter, he joined the Thomas-Morse Airplane Company. In March 1915, he returned to Detroit and joined the General Aeroplane Company, where he led his first full design and build to his specifications, the Verville Flying Boat. On July 9, 1917, Verville married Bertha M. Kamrath in Escanaba, Michigan. He had three children with her, daughters Betty and Janet, and son Myron. Also in 1917, Verville left the General Aeroplane Company to become executive engineer of Fisher Body Corporation, where he supervised the construction of de Havilland DH-4 airplanes. U.S. Army service In June 1918, Verville joined the Engineering Division of the U.S. Army Air Service (USAAS) as a civilian, and was based out of the USAAS Engineering Division at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio. In 1920, the young engineer gained national prominence when his Verville-Packard R-1 won the Pulitzer Speed Classic Trophy at the first held National Air Races (at Roosevelt Field, New York) by finishing first out of twenty four other planes, achieving a top speed of 156.54 mph. In 1919 Brigadier General Billy Mitchell requested the Engineering Division to design a light-weight \"motorcycle of the air\" that could operate as a liaison between Army field units. Verville completed the Messenger design in early 1920. The Lawrence Sperry Aircraft Company of Farmingdale was contracted to build five Messengers in April 1920. The first Messenger flight was on November 1. Later designated the Verville-Sperry M-1 Messenger, the plane is notable for its small size, simple construction, and inexpensive cost, which made it ideal for testing and experimentation. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics used one in its pioneering aerodynamic research programs from 1923 to 1929. Sperry modified twelve into the radio-controlled Messenger Aerial Torpedo and developed the apparatus for a Messenger to make the first successful airship hook on and release in December 1924. Following World War I, in the capacity as an engineering advisor, Verville joined General Billy Mitchell and his aide, Lieutenant Clayton Bissell, on their sailing trip to Europe in December 1921. The three men toured France, Italy, Germany, Holland, and England in order to check on the European progress of aviation. From their research they produced a 206-page report, which was published as a U.S. Army Air Service Information Circular. General Mitchell asked Verville to incorporate some of the European developments they had observed and to produce",

The resulting plane, the Verville-Sperry R-3, was the second plane to utilize retractable landing gear and incorporated many features advanced for its time. The completion of the R-3 encountered challenges because the planned Curtiss D-12 engine was not available. So, instead Verville had to use the problematic Wright H-3 (Hispano) engine, which had major vibration issues. Three R-3s competed in the 1922 National Air Races, but only one finished in 5th place with a top speed of 181 mph. After the 1922 race, Verville was able to finally obtain a Curtiss D-12 engine. It was installed on an R-3 and based on trials, it was determined that it could break a world record. On March 31, 1923, with Orville Wright officially observing from the ground, pilot Lieutenant Alexander Pearson Jr. set a 500 km world speed record of over a 10-lap course at Wilbur Wright Field. For the 1924 National Air Races, his R-3 won the 1924 Pulitzer Speed Trophy at 216 mph. While at the Air Service, Verville was awarded eight aeronautical patents for technologies such as airplane truss design, radiator mounting, and an automatic gun mechanism. Buhl and Verville Aircraft Companies In 1925, Verville left the government service to co-found the Buhl-Verville Aircraft Company with the Buhl family in Detroit. On March 29, 1927, Buhl was awarded the first Approved Type Certificate for its Buhl-Verville CA-3 Airster (i.e. A.T.C. No. 1) issued by the Aeronautics Branch of the Department of Commerce on March 29, 1927. There were a total of 20 of this aircraft manufactured and it broke a number of speed and endurance records, placing at the top of the Ford National Reliability Air Tour and the National Air Races. Verville was the chief designer from the company's founding in 1925 until 1927. In 1928, Verville left Buhl-Verville to establish the Verville Aircraft Company, also in Detroit. The company sought to market planes to the wealthy private owner. Verville Aircraft produced the Verville Air Coach, a four-passenger, high-wing monoplane, which made its debut at the 1929 Detroit Air Show and the Verville Sport Trainer, a two-seat tandem biplane. The United States Army Air Corps purchased four Sport Trainers under the designation YPT-10. The USAAC tested with five different engine versions resulting in YPT-10 thru YPT-10D designations. Bureau of Air Commerce and consulting Verville joined the Aeronautics Branch of the Department of Commerce in 1933. The Aeronautics Branch became the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934. During his time there, Verville served in the following roles: aeronautical engineer; chief of the Manufacturing, Engineering, and Inspections Service; and finally assistant chief of the Aeronautic Development Section. In his role as chief of the Manufacturing, Engineering, and Inspections Service, he was in charge of the reviews for issuing type certificates for all manufactured airplanes. Verville left government service to be a consultant for companies including Douglas Aircraft (1937–38), Curtiss-Wright (1941–42), Snead Aircraft (1942), and the Drexel Aviation Company (1942–45).

He was the brother and successor of Khurshid of Dailam. Biography Justan is first mentioned in 865, when he was placed on the Justanid throne by his suzerain, the Alid ruler Hasan ibn Zayd, who had deposed Justan's brother Khurshid because of his hostility towards the Alids. In 866/7, Justan fought against the Abbasid governor of Ray, 'Abd-Allah ibn 'Aziz. Justan eventually won, killing and capturing many inhabitants of the city. Justan later agreed to leave the city after having been paid 2,000,000 dirhams. In 869, the Abbasid military officer Muflih al-Turki invaded Tabaristan, and defeated Justan at the nearby city of Qazvin. Fortunately for the Alids, however, Muflih shortly left the region. In ca. 889, Justan aided the new Alid ruler Muhammad ibn Zayd against the ruler of Khorasan, Rafi ibn Harthama. In 900,",

They also shortly managed to defeat Justan, but failed to conquer his territory. Some time later, Justan welcomed another Alid named Hasan al-Utrush, who had taken refugee at Ray after the Samanid conquest of Tabaristan. Together, Justan and Hasan tried in 902 and 903 to recover control of Tabaristan, but without success. Worried by the fickleness of Justan, Hasan resolved to build a power base of his own. He therefore went on a mission to the as-yet unconverted Gilites and Dailamites to the north of the Alborz mountains, where he preached in person and founded mosques. His efforts were swiftly crowned by success: the mountain Daylamites and the Gilites east of the Safid Rud river recognized him as their imam with the name of al-Nāṣir li'l-Ḥaqq (\"Defender of the True Faith\") and were converted to his own branch of Zaydi Islam, which was named after him as the Nasiriyya and differed in some practices from the \"mainstream\" Qasimiyya branch adopted in Tabaristan following the teachings of Qasim ibn Ibrahim. This development threatened the position of Justan, but in the ensuing showdown between the two Hasan was able to affirm his position and compel Justan to swear allegiance to himself. Justan was murdered in 919 by his brother Ali of Dailam, who became the new ruler of the Justanids However, Justan's murder was shortly avenged by his son-in-law Muhammad ibn Musafir who had married his daughter Kharasuya and was from another Dailamite dynasty known as the Sallarids, which ruled over Tarum.

Biography Yeung attended Hochstein School of Music & Dance in Rochester, New York and graduated in 1995. He was first introduced to the death metal genre in the 1980s. His breakout performance was in 1999 on Hate Eternal's debut album Conquering the Throne, after which he became a big name in the death metal scene. Although Yeung left Hate Eternal after the release of Conquering the Throne, he started lending his talents as a live session drummer, such as with American metalcore band All That Remains, death metal bands Vital Remains and Nile, and as a studio drummer on ...And Time Begins by Decrepit Birth. Yeung was the drummer and co-founder of the death metal/metalcore band Divine Heresy and can be heard on their debut album, Bleed the Fifth and their second studio album, Bringer of Plagues. He was also the drummer of World Under Blood, CKY frontman Deron Miller's death metal side project. He replaced Pete Sandoval in Morbid Angel for their 2011 album Illud Divinum Insanus due to Sandoval's back surgery and was their official drummer until June 2015.

In 1910, he moved his law practice from Prescott to Kingman. In 1911, Herndon ran to become the attorney for Mohave County, winning in the general election in December, in which he ran unopposed. In 1914, he ran for re-election, defeating S. D. Stewart in the Democrat's primary, and then easily defeating Republican Ross S. Blakely in the general election in November. In August 1916, Herndon resigned as county attorney. From 1915 through 1917 Herndon was part of several groups which incorporated mining entities in Arizona. Those entities included the Arizona-Cerbat Mines Company, Victor Copper Company, Red Gap Gold Mines Company, Oatman Standard Mines Company, and Arizona C. O. D. Mines Company. In August 1918, Herndon announced his intention to run for the Arizona State Senate seat from Mohave County. In a hotly contested primary, Herndon beat out four other Democrats for the nomination, and then won November's general election. In 1918 and 1919 Herndon was part of the formation of three companies in Arizona, two mining and one oil development: the Arizona-Brunswick Mining Company, the Chloride Tunnel Company, and the Community Oil Company.

He was the nephew of the early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft and cousin to Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, the author of Frankenstein. Life Edward Wollstonecraft was born to a London solicitor of the same name, the eldest brother of Mary Wollstonecraft. One of the reasons the young man sought to build a life away from England was to escape the notoriety which attached to his aunt, author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. In 1812, while travelling from Lisbon to Cadiz, he met Alexander Berry, with whom he later formed a trading partnership, intending to operate in the colony of New South Wales. The two men shared lodgings in Cadiz while the city was under siege; they also lived together in London from 1815 to 1819, with Wollstonecraft's sister Elizabeth as part of their household; the couple eventually married. Wollstonecraft arrived in Sydney on board the ship Grenada on 31 August 1819. He received a land grant from Governor Lachlan Macquarie for 2,000 acres (8 km²), 500 acres (2 km²) of which were located on the north shore of Port Jackson running from what is now to the foreshore. A warehouse was erected in George Street, Sydney, under the name of \"Berry and Wollstonecraft\". In 1822, Wollstonecraft and Berry were granted 10,000 acres (40 km²) of land on the Shoalhaven River (now the site of Coolangatta Estate) on the condition that they took responsibility for a hundred convicts. They built Australia's first canal there, with the assistance of Hamilton Hume and a party of convicts. The 209 yard long canal was completed in 12 days. The crops farmed at Shoalhaven included native cedar and tobacco, which were sold at considerable profit both to the growing colony at Sydney and for export. The property at Shoalhaven grew to 40,000 acres (162 km²) under Berry's management, while Wollstonecraft looked after business in Sydney. Edward Wollstonecraft was active in local affairs, and involved in a number of societies and organisations in the colony. These included the Philosophical Society of Australasia (now the Royal Society of New South Wales), of which he was a founding member, and the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales, serving as steward and secretary during the 1820s.",

After studying theology at Zürich he became a pastor in 1817 and returned as teacher to his native town, where he lived for ten years. He was then appointed professor of German language and literature in the cantonal school in Aargau, however he lost the post in the political quarrels of 1830. He afterwards obtained the post of teacher and rector of the cantonal college, and was also appointed assistant minister at the parish church. He died in Baden, Aargau. Fröhlich is best known for his two heroic poems, Ulrich Zwingli and Ulrich von Hutten, and especially for his fables, which have been ranked with those of Hagedorn, Lessing and Gellert.

Corporate history Smoothie King was founded in 1973 in Kenner, Louisiana by Steve and Cindy Kuhnau. , Smoothie King was still a privately held company. In 2012, Wan Kim—a South Korean Smoothie King franchisee since 2002—bought the company from the Kuhnaus. Kim then acquired (equivalent to about $M in ) from Standard Charter Private Equity and National Pension Fund to grow the company. To succeed in this growth, Kim had several plans for Smoothie King. Kim planned to open 800 new franchises and the company's first 200 corporately-owned stores. He also planned to experiment with selling salads and wraps at these latter locations (in South Korea, they made over 20% of Kim's revenue). In 2009, Smoothie King's per-store revenue was about , and had reached by 2012. Corporate-wide, revenues were in fiscal year 2017, and in fiscal year 2018. In early 2014, Smoothie King contracted with the New Orleans Pelicans to rename the New Orleans Arena, Smoothie King Center. The contract was for 2014–2024, and Smoothie King has the option to extend the contract through 2034. The National Basketball Association required that all Smoothie King products be tested before the deal was completed, to ensure that they didn't contain any league-banned substances; testing was an eight-month process. Personnel CEO since 2012, Wan Kim had Tom O'Keefe as Smoothie King's corporate president in 2014, and in February 2019 he replaced Jennifer Herskind with Rebecca Miller (previously of On the Border Mexican Grill & Cantina) as chief marketing officer.

It amends the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991 to give primacy to the centrally appointed Lieutenant Governor of Delhi and make the elected Government of Delhi subsidiary. The elected government will now have to seek the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor for any executive action. Description The GNCTD Act, 1991 provides a framework for the functioning of the Legislative Assembly and the government of the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi. The Act amends certain powers and responsibilities of the Legislative Assembly and the Lieutenant Governor. The 2021 Amendment provides that the term \"government\" referred to in any law made by the Legislative Assembly will imply Lieutenant Governor (LG). The Amendment allows the Legislative Assembly to make Rules to regulate the procedure and conduct of business in the Assembly. The Amendment provides that such Rules must be consistent with the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Lok Sabha. It prohibits the Legislative Assembly from making any rule to enable itself or its Committees to: (i) consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the NCT of Delhi and (ii) conduct any inquiry in relation to administrative decisions. Further, the Amendment provides that all such rules made before its enactment will be void. The Amendment requires the LG to reserve certain Bills passed by the Legislative Assembly for the consideration of the President. These Bills are those: (i) which may diminish the powers of the High Court of Delhi, (ii) which the President may direct to be reserved, (iii) dealing with the salaries and allowances of the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, and members of the Assembly and the Ministers, or (iv) relating to official languages of the Assembly or the NCT of Delhi. The Amendment requires the LG to also reserve those Bills for the President which incidentally cover any of the matters outside the purview of the powers of the Legislative Assembly.This also specifies that all executive action by the government, whether taken on the advice of the Ministers or otherwise, must be taken in the name of the LG. The Amendment adds that on certain matters, as specified by the LG, his opinion must be obtained before taking any executive action on the decisions of the Minister/ Council of Ministers.

It is located to the north of Haywards Heath and the south of Balcombe. Known for its ornate design, the structure has been described as \"probably the most elegant viaduct in Britain.\" Construction of the Ouse Valley Viaduct commenced by the London & Brighton Railway company in 1839. It was designed by the principal engineer for the line, John Urpeth Rastrick, in association with the architect of the London to Brighton railway, David Mocatta. The viaduct is high and is carried on 37 semi-circular arches, each of , surmounted by balustrades, spanning a total length of . Each pier contains a jack arch with a semi-circular soffit, which had the benefit of reducing the number of bricks required. The roughly 11 million bricks required for its construction were mostly shipped up the River Ouse (via Newhaven and Lewes) from the Netherlands. On 12 July 1841, the viaduct was officially opened to train services, although the structure was not fully completed until the following year. Despite the structure's fine design, materials, and architectural features, the viaduct has had an expensive and problematic history. The first major restoration work occurred during the 1890s, during which sections of the original brickwork were entirely replaced in the belief that this would increase the structure's strength. However, the viaduct suffered considerable decay during the majority of the twentieth century. By May 1983, the viaduct had been recognised as a Grade II* listed structure. Between March 1996 and September 1999, the viaduct was subject to an extensive restoration by national rail infrastructure owner Railtrack; this work was part-funded by the Railway Heritage Trust, English Heritage and West Sussex County Council.

The route selected, which was surveyed by a team headed by Sir John Rennie, was fairly direct but had the downside of crossing over some relatively hilly terrain. As a consequence of a decision to limit gradients along the line to 1 in 264, the construction of a total of four tunnels and a single viaduct, the latter crossing the Ouse Valley between Balcombe and Haywards Heath in West Sussex, was necessary. Construction of the new line commenced in July 1838; work to build the ornate viaduct began during the following year. It was designed by the principal engineer for the line, John Urpeth Rastrick, in association with the architect of the London to Brighton railway, David Mocatta. The contractor appointed for its construction was Benjamin Baylis. The total cost of the viaduct's construction reportedly came to £38,500 (equivalent to £ in ). The viaduct was designed as a relatively elegant structure, being around in length and carrying a straight line over 37 identical arches. Each of these semi-circular arches had a span of and was supported upon tapered red-brick piers. Each pier was almost divided into two separate halves by vertical voids, capped by semi-circular rings at the top and base, as a weight-saving measure. This approach is credited with giving the structure a relatively slender appearance. The foundation of each pier is provided with two courses of inclined footings, which have a total depth of just over . The viaduct is predominantly composed of traditional red bricks and smooth limestone. The contrast between the two materials effectively highlights the deck and upper elements of the structure, although the limestone has been subjected to considerable weathering and staining since its original installation. The brickwork and the limestone elements have been replaced over time to maintain the structure's integrity, extend its operational life, and restore its appearance to better resemble its original state. At its highest point, the Ouse Valley Viaduct is above the river beneath it. It has been estimated that around 11 million bricks, many of which had been shipped across the English Channel from the Netherlands to Newhaven and Lewes, in addition to some locally produced bricks, were used for the structure. Furthermore, Caen stone was also brought from Normandy in France; this material was used for the classically balustraded parapets, string courses, pier caps and the four small rectangular Italianate pavilions. Building materials were transported to the construction site on barges up the Ouse River Navigation. At each end of the abutment is an ornamental square open tower, the brickwork of which is faced with stone from Heddon Quarries near Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Opening The Brighton Main Line was opened in two sections because completion was delayed by the need to construct some major earthworks.

By 1846, the viaduct had become part of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway. In 1923, as a result of the Railways Act 1921, it became part of the Southern Railway network. It remained under Southern's ownership until January 1948, when the nationalisation of the Big Four railway companies formed the publicly owned railway operator British Railways. Maintenance and restoration The first major restoration work occurred during the 1890s, and was focused on repairs to the brickwork. Engineers of the late Victorian era were concerned that the original lime mortar used in the viaduct's construction was inadequate and the decision was made to replace it with cement mortar. However, the replacement facing brickwork and substandard mortar eventually caused its own failures prompting more expensive repairs later on. This was likely due to the repair work having borne a greater share of the structure's load than intended, resulting in an accelerated failure rate. Poorly bonded header bricks are another probable culprit for its ineffectiveness. Additionally, the parapets and pavilions, although made from Caen stone (a high-quality limestone), have been subjected to heavy weathering. By 1956, the damage to the viaduct was extensive but the cost of refurbishment work was deemed too high by British Rail. The degradation was partially a consequence of the structure's long lifespan: when originally constructed in the 1840s, its intended design life was only 120 years. By May 1983, the viaduct had been officially recognised as a Grade II* listed structure. By the 1980s, the eight pavilions present on the viaduct were in such a poor condition that some of their roofs had fallen in and the installation of internal props was required to halt their further collapse. As a consequence of its heritage status, all envisioned alterations to the viaduct need to be reviewed and agreed upon by English Heritage. When British Rail proposed to dismantle the original pavilions and rebuild them using reconstituted stonework, English Heritage refused permissions; accordingly, there was no substantial restoration performed to the viaduct during this period, a decision which British Rail publicly attributed to the sizeable estimated cost of such works. The fabric of the structure continued to deteriorate over the next decade, with sections of stonework falling away from the balustrades and parapets. Starting in March 1996, the viaduct underwent a £6.5 million renovation overseen by the national rail infrastructure company Railtrack and partially funded by grants from West Sussex County Council, Railway Heritage Trust and English Heritage. Harder-wearing limestone was imported from Bordeaux to ensure the closest match with the existing Caen stone in the balustrades and pavilions. Some of the piers had to be reconstructed because of failures in the Victorian brickwork. The new bricks were handmade in a variety of sizes to suit the existing brickwork and set in sand, cement, and lime mortar; stainless steel anchoring was used to firmly fix the new stone to the old stonework.

Adding to Father O'Banion's troubles is the mission's cook Siu Lan, an attractive Chinese girl who makes no secret of her love for him. Under the leadership of Ho San, the communists wreck the mission dispensary and desecrate the chapel. Ho San straps O'Banion to a chair and rapes Siu Lan. Later, when she gives birth to a son, Ho San displays paternal pride but refuses to stop persecuting the priests. Only after the villagers revolt and his superiors order the killing of all Christians, including his parents, does Ho San become convinced that communism will never solve China's problems. He tries to smuggle Siu Lan, his son and the two priests out of the compound, but their journey is halted within a few miles of freedom by a helicopter sent to prevent Ho San's defection. Before he can be restrained, the Father Bovard dons Ho San's military cap and coat and drives away in the colonel's car. He dies in a spray of bullets from the helicopter, but his sacrifice enables the others to escape.

PPX is a processive exophosphatase, which means that it begins at the ends of the polyphosphate chain and cleaves the phospho-anhydride bonds to release orthophosphate as it moves along the polyphosphate molecule. PPX has several characteristics which distinguish it from other known polyphosphatases, namely that it does not act on ATP, has a strong preference for long chain polyphosphate, and has a very low affinity for polyphosphate molecules with less than 15 phosphate monomers. PPX plays an important role in the metabolism of phosphate and energy in all living organisms. It is especially important for maintenance of appropriate levels of intracellular polyphosphate, which has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions including response to stressors such as deficiencies in amino acids, orthophosphate, or nitrogen, changes in pH, nutrient downshift, and high salt, and as an inorganic molecular chaperone. PPX is classified as a polyphosphatase, which are part of the large DHH phosphoesterase family. Both subfamilies within this super family share four N-terminus motifs but have different C-terminus moieties.

The amount of remaining labeled polyphosphate is then measured by liquid scintillation counting. History PPX was discovered by the lab of Nobel laureate Arthur Kornberg in 1993 and is part of the polyphosphate operon along with polyphosphate kinase, the enzyme which synthesizes polyphosphate. The Kornberg lab was very interested in polyphosphate and published a series of papers elucidating the metabolism and roles of polyphosphate in vivo. Their interest in polyphosphate led them to identify and characterize the polyphosphate operon (which includes polyphosphate kinase [PPK] and PPX) and develop a wide variety of assays and techniques for quantification of polyphosphate production and degradation, in vitro and in vivo. The results of these studies of polyphosphate by the Kornberg lab led Kornberg to speculate that due to its high energy and phosphate content and the degree to which it is conserved across species, polyphosphate may have been the precursor to RNA, DNA, and proteins. Structure The structure of PPX is characterized by the actin-like ATPase domain that is a part of this superfamily. In Aquifex aeolicus it contains a ribonuclease H-like motif that is made up of a five-stranded β-sheet with the second strand antiparallel to the rest. A few of the strands are connected by helical segments that are longer in the C-terminal domain than in the N-terminal domain. Five alpha-helices are located in the C-terminal domain and only two are located in the N-terminal domain. The closed configuration of the enzyme is referred to as the type I structure. This configuration shares similar features to other members of this superfamily, including the N-terminal and C-terminal domains being separated by two alpha-helices centered on the structure. The more open arrangement of the domains displays rotational movement of the two domains around a single hinge region. The structural flexibility has been described as a \"butterfly like\" cleft opening around the active site. In E. coli, exopolyphosphatase exists as a dimer, with each monomer consisting of four domains. The first two domains consist of three beta-sheets followed by an alpha-beta-alpha-beta-alpha fold. This is different from the previously described Aquifex aeolicus homolog which lacks the third and fourth domains. To date, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with Protein Data Bank accession codes 1T6C, 1T6D, 1U6Z, and 2FLO. Active Site The active site of exopolyphosphatase is located in the clefts between domains I and II. In E. coli, this region contains a loop between strands beta-1 and beta-2 with the amino acids glutamate and aspartate (E121, D143, and E150). These residues, along with K197 are critical for phosphate binding and ion binding which is commonly seen among other ASKHA (acetate and sugar kinases, Hsp70, actin). In A. aeolicus, the active site of the enzyme exists in a cleft between the two domains. It is seen that catalytic carboxyl groups in this cleft are important for the enzyme activity, specifically Asp141 and Glu148.

Mechanism Exopolyphosphatase cleaves a terminal phosphate off of polyphosphate through the amino acid side chains of glutamate and lysine. Glutamate activates water, allowing it to act as a nucleophile and attack the terminal phosphate. The oxygen that was previously bridging the two phosphate atoms then abstracts a hydrogen from the nearby lysine residue. Function Polyphosphates are utilized by exopolyphosphatase enzymes, which cleave portions of the chain of phosphates. These proteins play an essential role in the metabolism and maintenance of polyphosphates. Polyphosphate is located throughout the cytosol of each cell and is also present in the cell's organelles. There are many classes of exopolyphosphatases, each with their own unique localization and properties. It has been speculated that once the polyphosphates are broken down, they are involved with signaling molecules acting as secondary messengers. In E. coli, the regulation of polyphosphate metabolism is poorly understood. Polyphosphate is a linear chain of phosphates linked together by phosphoanhydride bonds. Polyphosphate is found in all living organisms and plays an essential role in the organisms survival. In bacteria, polyphosphate is used to store energy to replace adenosine triphosphate. It has also been shown to be involved with cell membrane formation and function, enzyme regulation, and gene transcriptional control. In mammals, polyphosphates are involved with blood coagulation and inflammation, immune response, bone tissue development, and brain function. It has been shown in a yeast model that mutant yeast deficient in exopolyphosphatase activity had problems in respiration functions and metabolism of inorganic polyphosphates. Conversely, yeast strains that have higher levels exopolyphosphatase enzyme are shown to have no obvious growth defects under phosphate deficiency or excess phosphate conditions, however the level of polyphosphate in the yeast was much lower due to the increased number of enzymes breaking the polyphosphate chains down. Potential Clinical/Industrial Relevance E. coli mutants which are unable to synthesize polyphosphate die after only a few days in stationary phase. Strategies to inhibit polyphosphate accumulation in bacteria are therefore of interest as potential antibacterial treatments. This can be accomplished via inhibition of polyphosphate kinase, enhancement of exopolyphosphatase activity, or both. Polyphosphate accumulation is also of interest for a variety of industrial applications including removal of Pi from aquatic environments via enhanced biological phosphorus removal and for its role as a molecular chaperone in expression of recombinant protein. Because of the activity of polyphosphate as a molecular chaperone, strains of E. coli which accumulate polyphosphate could be used to increase yield of soluble recombinant protein. Recombinant exopolyphosphatase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae protects against mortality and restores protective immune responses in pre-clinical sepsis models.

The historical archdiocese of Brindisi was promoted from a diocese in the tenth century. The territory of the diocese of Ostuni was added to it in 1821. The archdiocese lost its status as metropolitan see in 1980. History There is no historical proof for early beginnings of Christianity in Brindisi, except the account given by Arnobius, who died c. 330, of the fall of Simon Magus, who withdrew to Brindisi and cast himself from a high rock into the sea. According to a local legend, the first Bishop of Brindisi was Leucius of Brindisi, about 165, who later underwent martyrdom. Leucius is called a confessor or, by Pope Gregory I, a martyr. He is said to have been from Alexandria in Egypt, to have come to Brindisi already a bishop, with his archdeacon, and to have baptised some 27,000 people. The earliest account of his life says he died under the Emperor Theodosius; Theodosius I ruled from 379–395, and Theodosius II from 408–450. Other versions put his death under Commodus, between 180 and 192, and yet others place his martyrdom under Valerianus, 253–259. That he was made a bishop from the east rather than one connected with Rome suggests that his story was worked on when Brindisi was subject to Constantinople, between the 8th and 10th centuries. Oria The Diocese of Brindisi at first embraced the territory comprised within the present diocese of Oria. In the tenth century, after Brindisi had been destroyed by the Saracens, the bishops took up their abode at Oria, on account of its greater security. In 1572–1591, during the tenure of the Spanish Bishop Bernardino de Figueroa movements were made to separate Oria as seat of a new diocese. The town was erected into an episcopal see on 8 May 1591 by Pope Gregory XIV, after the death of the Spaniard, Archbishop Bernardino de Figueroa. After an interval of four and a half years first bishop of Oria was appointed, Vincenzo del Tufo, in 1596.

Synods A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See. In 1608, Bishop Juan de Falces (1605-1636) presided over a diocesan synod. He held another, his third, on 10 September 1615. A fourth took place on 16 October 1616.

Acknowledgment Brindisi Brindisi BrindisiClan Blackadder is a Scottish clan. The clan historically held lands near the Anglo-Scottish border. Clan status Today Clan Blackadder does not have a chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, therefore the clan has no standing under Scots Law. Clan Blackadder is considered an armigerous clan, meaning that it is considered to have had at one time a chief who possessed the chiefly arms, however no one at present is in possession of such arms. The arms of Blackadder of that Ilk are blazoned as: Azure, on a chevron Argent three roses Gules. Name The clan name is a territorial name derived from the lands of Blackadder in Berwickshire. The lands, in turn, are named after the Blackadder Water, a river which is part of the River Tweed system, and which runs through the Scottish Borders. The name Blackadder is derived from the Old English awedur which means \"running water\" or \"stream\". George Fraser Black states that in 1426, Blakadir de Eodem",

According to a 1942 book on the Berwickshire dialect, the name was then pronounced ble-ke-TAR. Eminence in 1450–1518 Fife branch A junior branch moved to Tulliallan in Fife and included Robert Blackadder, bishop and then in 1492 the first Archbishop of Glasgow, who added the eponymous crypt and aisle in Glasgow Cathedral. The archbishop died while on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1508. The Fife branch were supporters of Clan Douglas. In 1471 the archbishop was also made Abbot of Melrose, not far from the main Blackadder lands. Sir John Blackadder of Tullialan was made a baronet in 1626. The title was allowed to lapse with his death, although the celebrated covenanting preacher John Blackadder (1622–1685) was legally the heir. The preacher's son Colonel John Blackadder later became governor of Stirling Castle. Main branch The Blackadders of that Ilk were Border Reivers, involved in the deadly raids and feuds along the Anglo–Scottish border during the 15th and 16th centuries. Their base by the Blackadder Water was near Berwick-upon-Tweed, a town that changed hands 13 times between England and Scotland in the period 1147–1482. The family gained lands from James II of Scotland in reward for their deeds in repelling in English raids. In 1518 the family lost their Border lands by the forced marriages of the two heiresses of Robert Blackadder of that Ilk to the neighbouring Clan Home (pronounced \"Hume\"). This process became known as \"the fraud of the Homes\". According to the 19th-century historian William Anderson, the marriages were achieved in the following way. This process was challenged by a Blackadder kinsman, Sir John Blackadder who held the lands of Tulliallan. He attempted to gain assistance from the Parliament, and also attempted to use force to regain the former Blackadder possessions. In March 1531, he was beheaded for the murder of the Abbot of Culross, in the dispute. Sir John Blackadder was succeeded by his brother Patrick, who also took action to regain the lands from the Homes. Anderson's version of events has Patrick ambushed and murdered by the Homes, while he was attempting to meet them and resolve the dispute. By 1567 the dispute had died down, as the Tulliallan branch and the Homes of Wedderburn were allies of Mary, Queen of Scots on the losing side in the important Battle of Carberry Hill. After the battle Mary abdicated as queen. Subsequently, the Blackadders relinquished their claim to the Border lands, and in 1671 Sir John Home was created Baronet of Blackadder. Some members of the clan continued to farm their lands as tenants of the Homes, and the last family burials at Edrom kirk were made in the 1980s William Francis Blackadder played in the Scottish rugby team in 1938, and was awarded the DSO and OBE as an RAF ace in World War II.

Trading accounts dealing in cents are handled the same way as any US dollar account with the only difference being the nominal amounts. History In 2006, the LiteForex company was the first in the world to offer the cent accounts. The technology of cent accounts was initially intended for developing and testing trading systems by working with real money. Advantage and disadvantage Retail brokerage companies say that cent accounts can be useful to Forex beginners since they allow trading with real money without risking too much. Cent account balance is indicated in cents, which helps beginners get accustomed to seeing sums of many thousands on their accounts. Cent account is a kind of a transitional stage between demo and dollar accounts being a first step into a real trading, an opportunity to decrease the minimum available position size to 0.0001 of a standard lot. There is no minimum or maximum deposit and no other specific requirements to open a cent account. The disadvantage of cent accounts is that the majority of Forex brokers offering such a service limit the maximum account and position size to keep the usage down to a minimum Also, the cent accounts are associated with higher quote spreads to compensate brokers.

Mentioning states that would likely be impacted by the storm, he incorrectly included Alabama, which by then was known not to be under threat from the storm. After many residents of Alabama called the local weather bureau to ask about it, the bureau issued a reassurance that Alabama was not expected to be hit by the storm. Over the following week, Trump repeatedly insisted his comment had been correct. On September 4, he showed reporters a weather map which had been altered to show the hurricane's track threatening Alabama. He also reportedly ordered his aides to obtain an official retraction of the weather bureau's comment that the storm was not headed for Alabama.

The NAPA report released on June 15 found that both Neil Jacobs, the acting NOAA administrator, and Julie Kay Roberts, the former NOAA deputy chief of staff and communications director, twice violated codes of the agency's scientific integrity policy amid their involvement in the NOAA statement. On July 9, the inspector general of the Commerce Department issued a report confirming that Commerce officials had responded to orders from the White House which resulted in the statement issued by the NOAA. A third report was published by the Biden administration's scientific integrity task force of the National Science and Technology Council and released in January 2022. Original comment In a tweet about the approaching hurricane on September 1, 2019, Trump said that \"South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\" By that date, no weather forecaster was predicting that Dorian would impact Alabama, and eight National Hurricane Center forecast updates over the preceding 24 hours showed Dorian steering well away from Alabama and moving up the Atlantic coast. Trump, who had (on August 29) canceled his trip to Poland to monitor the hurricane, was apparently relying on information that was several days old. About 20 minutes after Trump's tweet, the Birmingham, Alabama office of the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a tweet that contradicted Trump, saying that Alabama \"will NOT see any impacts from Dorian\". On September 9, NWS director Louis Uccellini said that the Birmingham NWS had not been responding to Trump's tweet, but rather to a flood of phone calls and social media contacts their office had received, asking if the hurricane was going to hit Alabama. \"Only later, when the retweets and politically based comments started coming to their office, did they learn the sources of this information,\" he said. He added that the Birmingham office \"did what any office would do to protect the public\", counteracting the wrong information to \"stop public panic\" and \"ensure public safety\". Later on September 1, Trump told reporters that the storm was indeed threatening Alabama. Over the following days, as the hurricane moved up the coast and Alabama felt no effects from it, Trump insisted repeatedly that he had been right about the hurricane threatening the state. On September 2, he criticized a reporter who had fact-checked his comment, saying he had been right and the fact-check was \"phony\". Altered map On September 4, 2019, in the Oval Office, Trump displayed the National Hurricane Center's August 29 diagram of Dorian's projected track.

He stated he had \"a better map\" with models that \"in all cases [showed] Alabama was hit.\" Later the same day, Trump tweeted a map by the South Florida Water Management District dated August 28, four days before his September 1 tweet, showing numerous projected paths of Dorian. Trump incorrectly asserted \"almost all models\" showed Dorian hitting Alabama, even though the map showed most predicted paths would not enter Alabama. A note on the map stated it was \"superseded\" by National Hurricane Center publications and that it was to be discarded if there were any discrepancies. Trump also said his briefings had included a \"95% chance\" that the storm would strike Alabama and that \"Alabama was hit very hard was going to be hit very hard.\" The Washington Post reported that NOAA had twice ordered National Weather Service employees not to provide \"any opinion\" on Hurricane Dorian and to \"only stick with official National Hurricane Center forecasts\". The first order came after Trump's September 1 comments and the Birmingham, Alabama National Weather Service's contradiction of Trump. The second order came on September 4, after Trump displayed the altered map. Following a Freedom of Information Act request by BuzzFeed News, the White House released more than 1,000 internal NOAA emails on January 31, 2020. In an internal NOAA email, staffer Corey Pieper confirmed to NWS Director of Public Affairs Susan Buchanan on September 4 that the map \"was doctored\", after the latter received an inquiry from NBC. Dr. Neil Jacobs, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and Prediction, wrote in an email to another NOAA scientist, \"you have no idea how hard I'm fighting to keep politics out of science.\" Responding to an inquiry from ABC News about the controversy, one internal NOAA email simply wrote \"HELP!!!\" NOAA acting chief scientist Craig McLean reacted to the unsigned NOAA statement in an email to other NOAA officials; McLean added, \"what concerns me most is that this administration is eroding the public trust in NOAA for an apparent political recovery from an ill timed and imprecise moment from the president.\" NOAA statement On September 6, NOAA published an unsigned statement in support of Trump's initial claim, saying that National Hurricane Center (NHC) models \"demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama.\" The statement also said the tweet from the Birmingham NWS office was incorrect because it \"spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\" The September 6 statement contradicted NOAA's September 1 statement that the \"current forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama.\" The",

The Commerce Department's Inspector General Peggy E. Gustafson said the next day that she was investigating the statement and directed NOAA employees to preserve all communications related to it. In a message to NOAA staff members, she wrote that the NWS \"must maintain standards of scientific integrity,\" adding that the statement called into question \"the NWS's processes, scientific independence, and ability to communicate accurate and timely weather warnings and data to the nation in times of national emergency.\" On September 9, The New York Times reported that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had called the acting administrator of NOAA, Neil Jacobs, and ordered him to undo the department's apparent contradiction of Trump. Jacobs objected, but was told that the top officials of NOAA would be fired if the disagreement was not resolved. The Commerce Department later issued a partial denial, saying \"Secretary Ross did not threaten to fire any NOAA staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian.\" Craig N. McLean, NOAA's acting chief scientist, said he would investigate how the resulting September 6 statement was issued. \"The content of this press release is very concerning as it compromises the ability of NOAA to convey life-saving information necessary to avoid substantial and specific danger to public health and safety,\" he said. \"I am pursuing the potential violations of our NOAA Administrative Order on Scientific Integrity.\" On September 11, it was reported that Ross had been told by Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to arrange for NOAA to support Trump's version of events and disavow the Birmingham message. According to The Washington Post, Trump himself told his staff they needed to get the contradiction fixed. The Post's sources say that Ross conveyed the message but did not threaten any firings. Trump denied the report saying, \"It's a hoax by the media. That's just fake news\". Members of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, which has jurisdiction over NOAA, have launched an investigation into the Commerce Department's interactions with NOAA regarding Dorian. They are specifically interested in the two directives from NOAA to the National Weather Service and the issuance of the September 6 statement.

The second of three investigations, the inspector general's examination of the NOAA decision to back Trump's Alabama assertions was the only one that was granted interviews with senior Commerce Department officials and secured access to White House communications. The report concluded: \"The Statement undercut the NWS's forecasts and potentially undercut public trust in NOAA's and the NWS's science and the apolitical nature of that science.\" Gustafson also commented that the scandal could have broader repercussions in 2020 because hurricane-prone states, such as Texas and Florida, are also being heavily affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The House Science Committee is also expected to release a report. On January 11, 2022, the Biden administration's scientific integrity task force of the National Science and Technology Council released \"Protecting the Integrity of Government Science\", a comprehensive report in collaboration with 29 separate federal agencies. The findings were structured as a general review of the government's current scientific policies as well as their ability to prevent political interference in the future.

Commentary Robert Reich called Trump's behavior irrational. \"I think we have to face the truth that no one seems to want to admit. This is no longer a case of excessive narcissism or grandiosity. We're not simply dealing with an unusually large ego [...] The president of the United States is seriously, frighteningly, dangerously unstable. And he's getting worse by the day.\" Timothy L. O'Brien called Trump \"unstable\" and said \"the world is in danger\". \"NOAA, an agency built on science and data engineered to provide reliable, impartial information and serve the public interest, wound up purging science and data from its public profile to cover for Trump. This is how good government decays when it's compromised by a cult of personality\" Cliff Mass, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington, published a blog post on the incident, noting that Neil Jacobs was being inappropriately attacked for simply trying to defend his agency.

The film's Western style, its feminist tone, and rural Indonesian setting led to the term \"satay Western\" being coined following its world premiere in the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. At the 38th Citra Awards, the film won 10 awards out of 15 nominations, breaking the records for most wins and nominations at Indonesia's top film awards previously held by Teguh Karya's 1986 film Ibunda with 9 awards out of 10 nominations at the 17th Citra Awards. It was also selected as the Indonesian official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards, but failed to secure a nomination. Plot In the first act, The Robbery, the film opens on the island of Sumba with Marlina grieving her late husband. A group of seven men, led by the aged Markus, arrive at her house intent on robbing Marlina of her livestock and raping her. They demand to be fed dinner, and she takes the opportunity to poison most of the robbers with chicken soup and decapitate Markus. She burns Markus' musical instrument, a jungga. In the second act, The Journey, she hitches a ride on the local bus where she encounters the pregnant Novi, on the way to find her jealous husband Umbu before she delivers. They are joined by an old woman with a dowry payment of two horses on the way to her nephew's wedding. Along the way, two of the other robbers (including Franz) discover the deaths and chase after Marlina. They hijack the bus, but Marlina escapes with one of the horses. Along the way, Marlina is haunted by a headless apparition playing the jungga. In the third act, The Confession, she arrives at the local police station and delivers a report of the robbery, rape, and her self-defense. The police accept the report but insist that they can't proceed for at least a month while they wait for funds to purchase rape test equipment. Marlina bonds with a young girl in a local warung. In the fourth act, The Birth, Novi finally finds Umbu. He, believing that a breech baby is a sign of infidelity, hits her and leaves her to be found by Franz, who threatens her into luring Marlina back to the house. The three meet at the",

Nugroho felt that the film would be better in the hands of a woman director due to its subject matter and because he felt like he had nothing new to add to it. According to Nugroho, the basic premise of the story is inspired by true events he witnessed firsthand while visiting Sumba in 1986 and 2004. Surya's collaborator and husband Rama Adi was immediately attracted to the story, but Surya took some time to figure out how she would make the film, as the rural setting is a departure from the urban settings of Jakarta she used in Fiksi. and What They Don't Talk About When They Talk About Love. The film was co-produced by studios from different countries: Surya's own Cinesurya, Kaninga Pictures and Purin Pictures (Thailand), Sasha & Co Production (France), Astro Shaw (Malaysia), and HOOQ (Singapore). Filming The film was shot in late 2016 with exterior shots taken on location in Sumba, East Nusa Tenggara and interior shots on a set built by the film's crew in Jakarta. The cast spent two months studying native Sumba language. Surya acknowledged that she was inspired by the Western film genre and found inspiration from Google Images of Sumba island during the dry season, which resembles the typical background of a Western film. Release The film made history as only the fourth Indonesian film ever to make the official selection of Cannes Film Festival following Eros Djarot's Tjoet Nja' Dhien and Garin Nugroho's Leaf on a Pillow in 1998 as well as Nugroho's Serambi in 2006.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Subversive, gorgeously shot, and suitably visceral, Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts injects timely feminist themes into a neo-western grindhouse framework.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100 from 13 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Variety's Maggie Lee gave the film a glowing review, praising Surya's ability to \"build nail-biting tension\" and ending the film with a climax that \"rivals any of [Quentin] Tarantino's high concept violence\". Lee coined the term \"satay Western\" to describe the film's Western style but told from a female perspective while incorporating Indonesia's traditional values and setting. The term has since been used in multiple media coverage of the film. Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times praised the film for \"eschew[ing] excess gore and mayhem, largely making its points in more subtly incisive ways. In a 3-star review, Godfrey Cheshire of RogerEbert.com singled out the film's \"confident eloquence of the staging, framing and editing\" and noted that \"the story is essentially a revenge fantasy like many another, but its feminist slant never feels rhetorical or heavy-handed. The whole thing is handled with sly wit as well as unfailing stylistic smarts, which makes for a very satisfying package.\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film \"an unwavering slow burn\" and praised Surya who \"smartly foregrounds all that comeliness and every so often folds in a long shot that turns the characters into doll-like figures, a downsizing that gestures toward a nature vs. culture dynamic\" Writing for The Jakarta Post, Stanley Widianto called the film \"one hell of a ride\" while noting its inspired take on the \"spaghetti western trope\".

The region included in the Ramsar wetlands extends further north in the region between the Ubangi and the Congo, as far as the town of Makanza on the Congo. Environment The Ubangi and Congo rivers join in the Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe region to form a huge area of flooded forest covering more than that varies in size seasonally. When the wetlands around Lake Télé in the Republic of the Congo are included, the area contains the largest body of fresh water in Africa. The two largest areas of open water are the shallow lakes Tumba and Mai Ndombe. Lake Tumba covers about depending on the season, connected via the Irebu channel with the Congo river. Water may flow into or out of the lake through this channel depending on the floods. Lake Tumba has 114 species of fish. Lake Mai Ndombe covers about and is surrounded by flooded forests and swamps. Both lakes support important fisheries. Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe is part of the moist tropical forest of the Congo Basin, which includes over 10,000 plant species. The diverse fauna includes many bird species. It is home to hippopotamus and to three types of crocodile. Forest elephants, forest buffalo and leopards are of particular interest to conservationists. The wetlands are estimated to have 150 species of fish. The brown waters of the flooded forests, with plant fragments suspended in anaerobic conditions, are home to endemic species of fish uniquely adapted to this environment. These include Protopteridae, Polypteridae, Notopteridae, Clariidae, Anabantidae, and Channidae. Objectives As a party to the Ramsar Convention, the DRC is obliged to identify wetlands of global importance and to ensure that they are used in a sustainable manner. Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe is considered important because the vegetation of the flood basin absorbs water during the rainy season and releases it later, regulating flooding downstream. It helps filter impurities from water that is used by millions of people, and it provides breeding sites for fish that provide food for the inhabitants of cities such as Brazzaville and Kinshasa. The wetlands and forests also serve as a major carbon sink, absorbing and retaining carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Efforts to gain recognition of the wetland began in 2004, with support from the USAID Central African Regional Program for the Environment, the Ramsar Convention and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The WWF took a leading role in developing technical plans. Official recognition was formally announced in Kinshasa in July 2008. The WWF has said it plans to continue working with international partners and with local communities to preserve biodiversity through sustainable development in the landscape.

They produce palm oil, groundnuts and rice as cash crops, and catch fish for shipment to large cities in the region.

The local population is growing at about 3% per year, one of the highest rates in the world, placing growing stress on natural resources. However, the region is still sparsely populated with 6–24 inhabitants per square kilometer. About 90% of the people outside the urban centers live on under $1 per day, and few have access to clean water. Maternal and infant mortality rates are high and diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS are prevalent. Governance in the region is weak and corruption is widespread. The central government does not provide funding to the provinces. Land tenure laws are poorly defined and applied. Laws regulating mining, agriculture and forest use are inconsistent and poorly enforced, causing conflict over rights to exploit resources. Logging concessions do not recognise traditional land rights and are causing unsustainable degradation of the forests. Other threats come from the expansion of oil palm plantations, commercial farms and from urbanization. Most of the people have little or no education. They use unsustainable quantities of firewood and charcoal as their main source of energy, and contribute to forest degradation through slash-and-burn cultivation. Fish stocks are declining due to overfishing using fine-mesh nets, including mosquito nets. Illegal bushmeat hunting and trapping to meet demand from the towns and cities is causing wildlife populations to decline. José Endundo Bononge, DRC Minister of Environment, says: \"The enemy of the forest is its misery and poverty… We cannot maintain and protect this forest with a miserable people, a poor population, who has no schools, no health care centres, no drinking water and no electricity\". Between 75% and 95% of rainfall in the Congo Basin is thought to be recycled as water vapor rises from the forests and marshes and falls again as rain. Rainfall has declined in recent years It is possible that a vicious cycle is setting in where degradation of the swamps and forest is causing reduced precipitation, which in turn is causing further degradation.

Intensely patriotic, he was one of the most prominent critics and leaders of the opposition to occupation, alongside Américo Lugo; though, as a result of his political writings, Fiallo was sentenced to 3 years of hard labor in 1920. Aside from his more patriotic works, Fiallo wrote romantic poems that evoke sensuous passion and profound tones of love. Of Fiallo’s prose, his chief claim to fame rests upon his two books of short stories —Cuentos Frágiles and Las Manzanas de Mefisto. The former was published in New York in 1908, with a second edition edited in Madrid in 1929. Las Manzanas de Mefisto was published in Havana in 1934. Cuentos Frágiles is popular throughout the world and has been translated to German, French, Italian, and Portuguese. He died in 1942 in Cuba in exile. Early life Fiallo was born on February 3, 1866, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. His interest in politics stemmed from his family’s deep political roots: his parents were Juan Ramón Fiallo Rodríguez, a politician and member of Congress of the Dominican Republic in 1867, and Ana María Cabral y Figueredo, the niece of the president of the republic, General José María Cabral. He first began writing poetry at the age of twelve, after falling in love. From a young age he also had the political guidance of his father, who took part in important committees to negotiate a Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Commerce between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. After joining the Faculty of Law at the Instituto Profesional de Santo Domingo (later as Instituto Profesional, en Universidad de Santo Domingo and now as Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo), he abandoned his studies to devote himself to politics and poetry. He was also uncle of fashion designer Oscar de la Renta and the politician Viriato Fiallo, the latter was also his son-in-law due to a cousin marriage between Viriato and Prudencia Fiallo, Fabio's",

He was imprisoned for defending Dominican independence during the American occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916–24). He was a founder of the newspapers El Hogar (1894), La Bandera Libre (1899), La Campaña (1905) y Las Noticias (1920) and was also a contributor to the Listín Diario and El Lápiz. Fiallo was arrested in the last months of 1900 with Arturo Pellerano Alfau, director of Listín Diario during the escalations of repression against the press of the Liberal government of Juan Isidro Jiménes. He was a member of the National Press Association, directed in 1916 by Arturo J. Pellerano Alfau which also included Américo Lugo, Conrado Sanchez, Juan Durán, Manuel A. Machado, and Félix Evaristo Mejía, among others. Through this group the first complaints to the international community in opposition to the U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic were performed. In 1916, Fiallo was apprehended by authorities, under the unfounded allegation of being involved in the revolutionary movement started on April 14 and headed by Desiderio Arias, and imprisoned in the Fortaleza Ozama. He was sentenced to five years of forced labor and was ordered to pay a five thousand dollar fine for having published an article in the Listin Diario before it could have been approved by the censorship committee. However, this did nothing to curtail Fiallo’s nationalistic output, which did not end with the demise of the Free Flag movement, in fact it made him more radical. In his \"Fabio Fiallo in the Free Flag: 1899–1916,\" Rafael Dario Herrera writes: \"In September 1899, he founded the newspaper The Flag Royalty circulating three times a week in major urban centers, and, like most print media at the time, had four pages, the first of which, contrary to what happens today, was entirely devoted to advertising and on the inside pages included opinion pieces with little news. At the time, newspapers were still generating income with fixed and placed with obituaries that lawyers and merchants, usually foreign subscriptions.

His remains rest in the National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic in Santo Domingo. Poetry and prose Despite his relative obscurity, Fiallo was intimate friends with Nicaraguan poet, Rubén Dario, the leader of the modernista movement, who was one of his most fervent admirers: \"Few times have I written about a poet with so much pleasure as now about Fabio Fiallo. I love the souls of pearl and the manners of silk.\" Fiallo was by nature cosmopolitan, elegant, and a lover of the beautiful, the luxurious, the refined, and the exotic. Critics have found in his poetic works an imitation of Becquer, Heine, and de Musset, however he himself denies the influence of both Heine and Becquer, saying he’s not as bitter and sarcastic as Heine nor a sorrowful grumbler like Becquer. Juana de Ibarbourou sees in him the Alfredo de Musset of America. She further says of him: “All in his verse is charming, sumptuous, and regal. One cannot find in Fabio Fiallo poems of the hoe and hammer; verses with the crazy rhythm of jazz, strophes that seem to be born in one of those machines that are killing in this world true poetry and noble manual work.

The bombing and fire had destroyed some of her lifeboats and life rafts, and her remaining boats and rafts were launched under a second Stuka attack. Hotspur reported seeing four bombs hit Slamat. At least two lifeboats capsized; No. 10 from overloading and No. 4 when, in the midst of transferring survivors, Diamond had to speed away from her to evade an air attack. One Stuka pilot, Bertold Jung, saw \"one or two\" fellow-pilots machine-gunning survivors in the boats. Jung had served in the German navy, and back at Almyros airfield he complained very strongly that people in lifeboats had suffered enough so in future they should be spared. Orion, Isis and Khedive Ismail kept moving to reach Souda Bay, while Calcutta rescued some survivors and ordered the destroyer Diamond to go alongside Slamat to rescue more. At 0815 hrs Diamond reported that she was still rescuing survivors and still under air attack. At 0916 hrs the destroyers , and arrived from Souda Bay in Crete to reinforce the convoy, so Calcutta sent Wryneck to assist Diamond. At 0925 hrs Diamond reported that she had rescued most of the survivors and was proceeding to Souda Bay. She left several people behind on life rafts, where aircraft machine-gunned them. Calcuttas captain said the attack continued until about 1000 hrs. Wryneck reached Diamond about 1000 hrs and signalled a request for aircraft cover at 1025 hrs. Diamond accompanied by Wryneck returned to Slamat, arriving about 1100 hrs. The destroyers found Slamats No. 10 and No. 4 lifeboats, both of which had been righted. They rescued 30 troops and two Dutch crew from No. 10 and Slamats Second Officer and several other survivors from No. 4. Slamat was afire from stem to stern, and Diamond fired a torpedo at her port side that sank her in a coup de grâce. By now Diamond carried about 600 of Slamats survivors, including Captain Luidinga. Loss of Diamond and Wryneck About 1315 hrs a Staffel of between four and nine Ju 87 bombers came out of the sun in a surprise attack on the two destroyers. One bomb hit Diamonds engine room, stopping her engines and bringing down her funnel, mast and radio aerial. Another exploded in the sea off her port side, holing her hull below her foredeck. Her engine room petty officer, H.T. Davis, had been on deck, but rushed below and released the pressure from her No. 3 boiler to prevent the risk of a boiler explosion. She sank in eight minutes.

Several men in the Carley floats died either from wounds or from drowning in the swell. They included Lt Cdr Robert Lane who commanded Wryneck, and Dr G.H. Brand who was the civilian ship's doctor on Slamat. Rescues Wrynecks whaler suffered two holes but was repaired. Her occupants were wet through, her compass was damaged and her drinking water contaminated. Her four oars were serviceable, so Commissioned Engineer Waldron took command and she set off east past Cape Maleas, towing two Carley floats and their occupants. In the evening the wind increased, causing the floats to strike the boat, so Waldron reluctantly cast them adrift. Waldron was also nursing a Leading Seaman, George Fuller, who had bullet wounds in his belly and thigh. At 1900 the cruiser and seven destroyers reached Souda Bay and disembarked evacuated troops. The Vice Admiral, Light Forces, Henry Pridham-Wippell, became concerned that Diamond was not among them. Between 1922 and 1955 hrs repeated attempts to radio Diamond drew no reply. Wryneck had been ordered to keep radio silence so no attempt was made to radio her. Instead Phoebe and Calcutta were asked if they had seen her, but their replies at 2235 and 2245 hrs were indefinite. Pridham-Wippell sent the destroyer to the position in the Argolic Gulf where Slamat had been lost. Griffin found 14 survivors in two Carley floats. At 0240 hrs she reported the rescue, said both destroyers had been sunk about 1330 hrs and she was still looking for Wrynecks whaler. In the morning she found more floats and another four survivors. She took the survivors to Crete. The last living survivor from Slamat, Royal Army Service Corps veteran George Dexter, states that after Wryneck was sunk he and three other men were rescued by Orion. On the morning of 28 April the whaler was about off Milos in the Aegean Sea, so she set course for the island. At noon she sighted Ananes Rock, about southeast of Milos, so Waldron decided to land there as everyone was exhausted. The rock has a bay, where the whaler found a caïque full of Greek refugees and British soldiers who had set out from Piraeus, were headed for Crete, but were sailing only by night to avoid detection. In the evening the caïque left Ananes and headed south for Crete. As many as possible of the survivors transferred to the caïque, but she was very full so she towed the whaler with five men still in it.

Casualties Nearly 1,000 people were killed in the loss of Slamat, Diamond and Wryneck. Of the 500 or so soldiers that Slamat embarked, eight survived. Of her complement of 193 crew and 21 Australian and New Zealand DEMS gunners, 11 survived. Of Diamonds 166 complement, 20 survived. Of Wrynecks 106 crew, 27 survived. Slamat had a mixed crew of 84 Goans, 74 Dutch, 24 Chinese, 10 Australians and a Norwegian. The 11 survivors were six Goans, four Dutch and one other. The bodies of three of Slamats crew washed ashore far from the wreck: apprentice helmsman J Pille on the Greek island of Stamperia, Second Officer G van der Woude at Alexandria in Egypt, and lamp trimmer J van der Brugge at Gaza in Palestine. Controversy Vice Admiral Pridham-Wippell held Slamat chiefly responsible of the disaster, asserting that her failure to depart until 75 minutes after she was ordered \"resulted in her being within range of the dive bombers well after dawn.\" In a volume of his history The Second World War, Winston Churchill wrote \"At Navplion there was a disaster. The Slamat, in a gallant but misguided effort to embark the maximum number of men, stayed too long in the anchorage\". The Dutch historian Karel Bezemer agreed that had Slamat obeyed orders and left on time, the convoy would not have been attacked. Frans Luidinga, who in 1995 published a book about his father Tjalling Luidinga, points out that had Slamat left on time, the convoy would have been only further south at the time of the attack. This was still in range from Jg 77's base at Almyros and unlikely to have given enough advantage to the RAF's diminished fighter cover. The Germans knew the convoy would spend the night of 26–27 April evacuating troops from Nauplia and would not be far beyond the Argolic Gulf by daybreak. Frans Luidinga blames the Royal Navy for including troop ships in the evacuation, asserting that only warships had the speed, manoeuvrability and firepower to return from Nauplia under fire. Against Luidinga's argument, the troop ship Khedive Ismail survived whereas the destroyers Diamond and Wryneck were sunk. And had the convoy been 20 nautical miles further south, Vendetta, Waterhen and Wryneck could have met it at 0800 instead of 0915 hrs, increasing both its anti-aircraft fire and capacity to rescue survivors. The distance from Almyros allowed the same Stukas to make repeated attack runs, although on the flight back to base one stopped at Corinth to refuel. Increasing their round trip by 40 nautical miles might have marginally reduced the aircraft's ability to attack repeatedly. The general situation was such that had Slamat left on time as ordered, it would have been more likely only to mitigate an attack rather than avert one.

The Admiralty took the unusual step of publishing in The London Gazette its citation for Fuller: \"who, though badly wounded, fought his gun till the last, and when his ship was sunk, heartened the survivors by his courage and cheerfulness\". In May 1945 the Netherlands were liberated and the Dutch government returned from exile. In August 1946 Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands wrote to Captain Luidinga's widow, expressing her sympathy for her husband's death, gratitude for his war service and commending him as een groot zoon van ons zeevarend volk (\"a great son of our seafaring people\"). British and Commonwealth troops and naval personnel who were lost in the sinking of Slamat, Diamond and Wryneck are named on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Athens Memorial in Phaleron Allied War Cemetery at Palaio Faliro southeast of Athens. Royal Navy personnel are also commemorated in Britain on the Royal Navy monuments at Chatham, Plymouth and Portsmouth. George Dexter commissioned a monument to all the service personnel lost when the three ships were sunk. It is in The Royal British Legion Club, Shard End, Birmingham. There was no Dutch monument to Slamat until 2011, when one commemorating victims from all three ships was made by the Dutch sculptor Nicolas van Ronkenstein.

It has deciduous leaves and grows to a height of 15 feet (4.5 m). This plant has a high demand for water, and thrives in swamps or wet areas. It requires a mildly acidic soil, with a pH between 6.1 and 6.5. Distribution The species is native to Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. It has spread to other parts of South America and many coastal southern United States as well as to parts of Africa. Due to its high demand for water, this species is often found on marshy shorelines. It also forms dense thickets and thrives in disturbed areas. Taxonomy The genus Sesbania is within the larger family Fabaceae. The Fabaceae are divided into three subfamilies: Mimosoideae (80 genera and 3,200 species) Caesalpinioideae (170 genera and 2,000 species) Faboideae (470 genera and 14,000 species) The genus Sesbania belongs to the subfamily Faboideae, which has the greatest amount of diversity within the family Fabaceae. The subfamilies Mimosoideae and Faboideae are largely monophyletic, whereas the subfamily Caesalpinioideae is considered paraphyletic. Habitat and ecology Flowers appear in late spring and persist until the autumn. In the United States, this species blooms between June and September, in South Africa between November and January. When the carpellous structures dry out, the seeds drop close to the base of the plant. The seed coats are impermeable, which",

This species is also commonly found near roadsides, maybe the seeds were imported with the soil used for construction. This species is shade-tolerant. Seedlings can produce flowers and seeds after three month, although flowering most commonly occurs at two years of age. The plant can survive frost, but not for prolonged periods of time . Morphology The deciduous leaves are alternate and compound. Between five and 20 pairs of elliptical leaflets occur on a single stalk. The leaf margins are commonly entire, with little or no serration. Each leaflet is oblong and ends in a pointy tip. The leaves contain stipules that are usually inconspicuous. The flowers and fruits droop at the tips of the stalks. The branches of this shrub are rather thin, and green, but turn a darker red brown when they mature. The bark varies from gray brown to red brown with obvious horizontal lenticels. Flowers and fruit The flowers are shaped like pea flowers, 2–3 cm long, and are commonly red-orange or red-purple. Flowers often form a raceme. Characteristic of the family Fabaceae, this species has five fused sepals and five free petals. The flower always contains ten stamens, sometimes with various combinations of fused filaments. The ovary is superior and the style is often curved. Characteristic of the subfamily Faboideae, these flowers are zygomorphic and have a specialized structure. The upper petal is referred to as the banner, and encapsulates the petals when they are in the bud. The two adjacent flowers, called the wings, overlap the bottom two petals. The bottom petals are often fused at the apex, forming a keel. The flowers appear \"showy\" because they are most commonly pollinated by insects, who are attracted by these features. The large pea pods are divided into four compartments and appear as if they have shrunk slightly due to drying These fruits are dehiscent and dry out as they become mature. Each fruit can contain between five and ten seeds, which are dispersed when the pod dries out and opens up. On average, a single plant can produce 100-300 pods. The immature pods are a yellow or green. As the season progresses, they turn a darker green, eventually becoming dark brown. Seedpods often stay on the plant far into the winter, and the seeds rattle when shaken by the wind, giving the plant its common name of “rattlebox”. Usage and economic importance These plants are used as ornamentals due to their graceful shape and beautiful red flowers. It can easily be grown from seeds, which require scarification in order to germinate. The species has been classified as invasive in many of the southern United States such as Virginia, California, Texas, and Florida. This shrub can often form dense thickets.

Its close relative S. virgata has been used to control soil erosion, rehabilitate disturbed areas, and revitalize riparian habitats. Juice made from the leaves of this plant reduces the response to painful stimulation and inflammatory edema in mice. Toxicity Sesbania puniceas contains toxic saponic glycosides. The poison can be dangerous to local birds and mammals. Human who ingests this plant or its seeds can become very sick and may suffer vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory failure, and death. Management The root systems of young S. punicea plants are not very extensive and the soil is loose under waterlogged conditions, so these plants can be removed by hand or simple garden tools. Trees with larger trunks can be cut and treated with glyphosate and/or triclopyr. If they are found in standing water, the stem can be cut to below the water level. Simply flooding the area will not kill them. Biological controls have also been used to prevent this species from spreading. The South American apionid weevil, Trichapion lativentre, was introduced to South Africa in the late 1970s. This weevil has now dispersed over most of the range of S. punicea. The adult weevils feed on the leaves and lay single eggs in premature flower buds. The larvae then feed on the stamens and carpels of the flower and pupate in the hollow husks of the buds. The weevil has prevented the rapid spread of S punicea in South Africa.

Traditional uses Due to its highly coveted fragrance, the essential oil produced from sandalwood is often used in aromatherapy, and is also added to soaps and cosmetics. It is used in Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of both somatic and mental disorders, including common colds, bronchitis, fever, urinary tract infections, and inflammation. A study investigating the effects of inhalation of East Indian sandalwood oil and its main compound, α-santalol, on human physiological parameters found that the compounds elevated pulse rate, skin conductance, and systolic blood pressure. There is also religious significance associated with sandalwood oil and it is used in many different religions around the world, including Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Zoroastrianism. Production The oil is distilled from the wood of the entire tree including stump and roots. Australian sandalwood (S. spicatum) is unique in that the white sapwood does not require removal before distilling the oil, while Indian Sandalwood (S. album) does require removal of the sapwood prior to distillation. Fragrance Sandalwood oil is used extensively for its woody-floral scent. It pairs well with other wood or floral scents such as violet, rose, tuberose, clove, and oakmoss. But since the wood is so rare and expensive, cosmetic companies are now trying to find synthetic substitutes to try to imitate the structure and scent of sandalwood. There are several synthetic odorants with odor similar to sandalwood oil, used as lower-cost alternatives for perfumes, emollients, and skin cleaning agents. Common synthetic substitutes include Sandalore, Bacdanlol, Ebanol, Osyrol, and Sandaxol. Two of these, Sandalore and Brahmanol, have been found to be agonists of the cutaneous olfactory receptor OR2AT4, with potential therapeutic benefits for wound healing. Natural sandalwood oil, and other synthetic sandalwood odorants, did not have the same effect. Safety There hasn't been extensive research conducted on the safety of sandalwood oil. But because there haven't been any significant adverse effects documented in scientific literature, it continues to be used cosmetically and in food A few studies were found to identify sandalwood oil's potential toxic effects, but it was determined to be safe at the present levels that the oil is used in food as flavorings.

Once there, he cast of his bright spear to smote Trojan leader Apisaon in the liver below the midriff and straightway loosed his knees. Later on, Lycomedes was one of the Greeks who takes gifts for Achilles from the tent of King Agamemnon as these two decisions to settle their dispute. During later fights, Lycomedes was wounded on his wrist or head and ankle by the Trojan Agenor. Notes References Homer, The Iliad with an English Translation by A.T. Murray, Ph.D. in two volumes.

Beverly's situation along on the ridge allowed the community to become an exclusive streetcar community, which is reflected in the homes and large lots. History Etymology In 1889, when the Rock Island Railroad realigned its suburban tracks, it expanded service north of 99th Street. The new station on 91st Street was named \"91st Street–Beverly Hills station\". By the late 1910s, the telephone network established a Beverly exchange. The exact significance of the name \"Beverly Hills\" is no longer known. Many speculate it is named after Beverly, Massachusetts, at the suggestion of Alice Helm French, a prominent resident and wife of the first director of the Art Institute of Chicago, or that the Rock Island Railroad simply named it after the hilly terrain. It is likely not named after Beverly Hills, California, which was named after the city in Massachusetts and received its name nearly 20 years after the 91st Street Station was named. 19th century Beverly and the surrounding area was sparsely populated by the Potawatomi and some white settlers until 1833, when the indigenous people ceded their land rights to the United States under Indian removal. The earliest known non-indigenous inhabitants of the area were DeWitt Lane, who settled near 103rd Street and Seeley Avenue in 1832, and Norman Rexford, who opened a tavern near 91st Street and Pleasant Avenue. The area famously became a dry settlement, prohibiting saloons and the sale of liquor. A permanent settlement was established with the sale of the land to John Blackstone in 1839. In 1844, Blackstone sold the land along the Blue Island Ridge from 91st to 115th Streets to Thomas Morgan, after whom Morgan Park is named. The transformation of the area to a suburban community began in 1869 when the descendants of Thomas Morgan sold his lands to the Blue Island Land and Building Company. The area, which was at the intersection of the Rock Island Railroad and the Panhandle Route, saw a substantial period of growth sustained by Chicagoans displaced by the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. It became an attractive community with the establishment of several schools in the 1870s. In 1874, much of Beverly and the area to the east was incorporated as the Village of Washington Heights. In 1890, the section of modern-day Beverly north of 95th Street was annexed to the City of Chicago. The section west of Western Avenue and south of 99th Street was added to Washington Heights.

Established in 2010, SAF/IEN focuses on fuel supply and logistics, aerodynamic drag reduction, propulsion efficiency, software development, optimized planning, and fuel data capture. Since 2015, Roberto Guerrero has served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Operational Energy. History Energy conservation in the Air Force dates back to the 1970s and initially focused on installations and facilities. Prior to 1972, the Air Force was converting coal-fired installations to oil or natural gas under a Department of Defense air pollution reduction program. After the Yom Kippur War, the energy crisis of the 1970s prompted the Air Force to identify their first energy reduction goals and monitoring systems. By the late 1970s, the Air Force had developed a 10-year energy reduction plan for its facilities under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. It also created the first Air Force Energy Office at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, which became the focal point for all of the service’s energy matters and policies. In 1985, the Air Force developed the Energy Information Management System, which was designed to collect all service energy data. Under this system, all Air Force installations were required to conduct energy security assessments every 1 to 3 years. In response to the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Air Force set new goals and mandates for utilities, increasing requirements for the use of clean energy, and improving overall energy efficiency. In an effort to achieve these goals, the Air Force began working with private industry to upgrade its facilities. Through Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC), industry made energy efficiency upgrades to facilities and the Air Force paid for them with the cost saved over time. The first of these was implemented at Randolph Air Force Base with Johnson Controls, where 14,500",

The Undersecretary of the Air Force was designated the senior Air Force Energy Official, a role traditionally reserved for senior Air Force facility engineers. This raised visibility of energy conservation and usage amongst Air Force and Department of Defense leadership. In 2006, the Air Force conducted the first flight by a military aircraft using a domestic synthetic fuel blend. The test was conducted at Edwards Air Force Base, California in a B-52 Stratofortress, and it culminated in four flights using all eight engines with the synthetic blend for the duration of each. The following year was a pivotal point in the history of Air Force Energy, beginning with Executive Order 13423 mandating that all Federal agencies operate in an energy-conscious manner. In 2008 Air Force Policy Memo (AFPM) 10-1 directed the development of an Energy Strategic Plan, designated Roles and Responsibilities, and created a new management structure under the Energy Program Management Office (EPMO) in 2009. The EPMO’s mission was to bring greater visibility to Air Force energy consumption trends and initiatives, and ensure energy was a consideration across Air Force missions. With energy’s quickly growing importance, Air Force leadership determined a broader effort was necessary. As a result, the EPMO became the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Energy) on 18 November 2010, appointing a Senior Executive Service (SES) as the Deputy Assistant Secretary to lead it, and becoming the first military service to identify energy as a major policy focus area. Present day The Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Operational Energy) currently has personnel integrated into Air Force Acquisition Operations, Aviation Operations, Facility Management, Expeditionary Operations, and Logistics. In addition, the Operational Energy Office has established a relationship with the US Department of Energy (DoE), to research future opportunities for integrating alternative fuels into Air Force operations. The office also employs an outreach staff to address energy culture change across the service Among other achievements, the Air Force Energy Office has led the first-ever pilot project to produce a 100% electric vehicle fleet at Los Angeles Air Force Base, California, directed the inaugural A-10 Warthog flight using a 50-50% blend of alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) and JP-8 fuel, and achieved nearly $1 million in utility cost savings from a new solar panel array at the US Air Force Academy.

A pioneer in epidemiology, he was notably the personal physician to Nasseredin Shah, the Qajar's 4th Shah, for more than 30 years. Life Joseph Désiré Tholozan was born in 1820 at Diego Garcia, a small atoll in Chagos Archipelago situated in the Indian Ocean, to French parents. He was the eldest of four children. He began his studies at Port Louis alongside Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard before continuing to the Lycée Thiers in Marseille. He then entered the Marseille School of Medicine, led by François Cauvière, a close relative then to Paris where he defended his thesis in 1843. He then entered the Military Health Service and became, in 1852, the first associate professor of medicine at the Hospital Val-de-Grâce. He also participated in the Crimean campaign in 1854 and 1855, where he made numerous observations on cholera. He then was called into Persia in 1858 to become the personal physician to Nasseredin Shah. He moved there and got married in 1866 to Iphigenia Pisani, from a prominent family from Constantinople. Professor Tholozan trained numerous Persian physicians and performed important observations on the epidemiology of the plague, cholera and other infectious diseases such as the Asian relapsing fever. Commander of the Legion of Honor and elected correspondent of the Academy of Sciences and the Medical Academy, Tholozan also played an important role in Franco-Iranian diplomatic relations accompanying the Shah during his three trips to Europe.

In the country, they are commonly known as \"Vlachs\" (Βλάχοι, Vláchoi) and referred to as \"Vlachophone Greeks\" or \"Vlach-speaking Greeks\", because most Aromanians in Greece have a Greek identity and identify themselves with the Greek nation and culture. History Byzantine historian George Kedrenos identified Aromanians living in what is now Greece in the 11th century. Under the Ottoman Empire, the Aromanians were considered part of the Rum Millet. In 1902, Alexandru Lahovary advocated for the recognition of the Aromanians as a distinct millet, which was granted in 1905. Like the Arvanites, Aromanians played an important role in the Greek War of Independence. The group became more distinct towards the end of the 19th century, with a split occurring between Vlachs who identified more closely with Romania and those who were linked more to Greece. Culture The Aromanians of Greece count with the Panhellenic Federation of Cultural Associations of Vlachs, a cultural organization of Aromanians. The Aromanian communities, who use the endonym Vlasi, in Macedonia speak Megleno-Romanian, separate from the Aromanian language. Music Cuisine Religion In the Ottoman Empire, the Vlachs fell under the religious jurisdiction of the Greek Patriarch by virtue of them being Orthodox Christian; services were conducted in Greek. Conducting services in the Aromanian language became a priority issue for the Vlachs. The Orthodox Patriarch decided that if the Vlachs were to conduct services in their own language, they would be denied their own clerical head. In 1875, the Patriarch ordered the closure of 8 Vlach churches, leading to an escalation in hostilities. The Ottoman Ministry of Justice and Religious Denomination determined in 1891 that the Vlach had a right to worship in their own language; in 1892, the Ministry of Justice warned the Greek Patriarch that if Vlach-language services were not instituted, the Vlachs would likely established their own church.

Early life pre World War I Charles Gossage Grey was born in Chicago, Illinois, on 20 June 1894, the son of Charles Scott, and he was later adopted by his stepfather Walter C. Grey. He attended Columbia University School of Journalism, and subsequently was a reporter with the Chicago Evening Post. World War I In February 1917 he volunteered his services with the American Ambulance Field Services in France, and in June of that year enlisted into the French Foreign Legion. He obtained his military flying license on September 29, 1917. He was then assigned to the Escadrille Spad 93 Lafayette Flying Corps as sergeant, where he remained until March 1918. Promoted lieutenant, he was then commissioned into U. S. service and assigned to the 213th Aero Squadron on 1 August 1918 as Flight Commander of its third flight. Between 2 September and 3 November 1918, he used his Spad XIII to score five aerial victories (ace). He was promoted to captain on 6 November 1918.

Charles and Cornelia had two sons, James, born in 1936, and Michael, in 1939. World War II At the outset of World War II, the Grey family remained in France. Both Charles and Cornelia were dismayed by the isolationist stance of the United States in the face of the German onslaught across the European continent, and they immediately volunteered their services in the defense of their country of adoption, not withstanding their U.S. citizenship. Cornelia joined I.P.S.A. (Infermières, Pilotes, Secouristes de l'Air), as a nurse and ambulance driver, active on the front and under fire during the German offensive of Northern France in June 1940, for which services she was attributed the \"Croix de Guerre' citation. Charles Grey volunteered his service to MI-6, the British Secret Intelligence Service, under the code name of \"L'ange Bleu\", and was known as \"The First Volunteer\". Activities included organizing the evacuation of SIS station in Paris, and its commanders \"Biffy Dunderdale\" and Sir Peter Smithers June 14–23, 1940, via Bordeaux. After the armistice, in late 1940, the family moved to the United States by way of Spain and Portugal. In 1942 Grey became an early member of the Office of Strategic Services, and was active in its X-2 counter espionage division, based in Lisbon Portugal. He was also active in various capacities in Finland (Red Cross), Poland, North Africa, and in France where he was a member of the F-2 \"Forces Françaises Combattantes\" resistance network under code name \"Gris\". His World War II service earned him a number of citations including the French Legion of Honor and Resistance Medal, the Polish Golden Cross of Merit., the Order of the White Rose of Finland, and the King's Medal for Courage from Britain. Post World War II Immediately following the liberation of Paris in 1944, the Grey family returned to their home there. Grey remained in U. S. diplomatic service in France, until his retirement in 1961. Following his divorce from Cornelia, Grey married Ivanka Boyovitch on July 8, 1960.

In 2023 several news reports drew parallels between this derailment and the 2023 Ohio train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, which also involved release of vinyl chloride. Background The accident happened when Jefferson Street Bridge, a swing bridge built in 1873 and jointly owned by Conrail and Norfolk Southern over Mantua Creek, failed to operate on November 30, 2012. Witnesses living adjacent to the tracks said that the accident happened at 2:50 am; the team said that derailment happened around 7:00 am. Seven cars of the 84-car consist derailed. Four tanker cars containing vinyl chloride fell into the creek; one tank was breached. As a result, the tank leaked about 23,000 gallons of the gas into the air. Vinyl chloride is used to make adhesives, polyvinyl chloride, plastics and other chemicals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has described the chemical as having an odor that can be described as sweet and mild. Low levels of exposure can cause sleepiness and dizziness. Higher level exposure can cause people to pass out or die. Long term exposure has been linked to liver cancer, and possibly lung, brain and some blood cancers. Results A voluntary and limited evacuation zone was created. Nearby schools were ordered to take shelter and seal off their buildings. At around 7:00 pm a new evacuation order was given. An estimated 500 to 700 people in a 12-mile radius of the site evacuated. People were told to pack for three days and then were transported to hotels in the area. About 70 people were treated at Underwood-Memorial Hospital in Woodbury for exposure to the vinyl chloride, of which 60 were hospitalized. Thousands of Paulsboro residents sued Conrail, the operator of the bridge over Mantua Creek. In subsequent interviews residents alleged that Conrail paid them off to prevent them from seeking more money in the event that they developed illnesses later. Equipment damages were estimated at $451,000. Emergency responses and remediation costs totaled about $30 million. The bridge had an earlier history of trouble. At around 3:00 am, on August 23, 2009, a coal train derailed; however, no cars fell off. Political controversies Responding to the immediate after-effects of the accident was the Unified Command response team. This group consisted of representatives of the U.S. Coast Guard, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, New Jersey Office of Emergency Management, the Paulsboro Fire Department and Conrail. However, the New Jersey Senate President Stephen Sweeney gave the response team an \"F.\" Sen. Sweeney asserted that the team delayed scheduling public meetings, and that the team issued conflicting and confusing orders in the wake of the derailment. Additionally, area residents criticized Governor Chris Christie for giving inadequate attention to Paulsboro's environmental problems and that they concentrated more of their attention on Hurricane Sandy (which struck New Jersey on October 28–29). They complained that he did not visit Paulsboro and that instead he sent Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno. Area Congressional Representatives Rob Andrews (NJ 1st-D) and Frank LoBiondo (NJ 2nd-R) visited",

Legacy The National Transportation Safety Board in a public hearing faulted the first responders for their actions. The investigators said that local authorities did not follow standard procedures for cleaning a chemical spill and that first responders were not provided proper breathing apparatuses, even though monitors indicated unsafe levels of chemicals in the air. They said that this led to further exposure of the first responders and the public to the vinyl chloride gas. Paulsboro police reported the gas as non-toxic, even after fire officials learned that the gas was highly flammable and dangerous to breathe. In March 2013, Conrail announced that the bridge would be replaced with an expected September 2014 operational date. Normally, between March 1 and November 30 the bridge would be left in the open position for maritime traffic and closed when trains approach. It remained locked in the closed position until the bridge was replaced. The new bridge opened in March 2015.

He is known worldwide for his portrayal of the precarious situation of the poor inhabitants of the Brazilian sertão in his novel Vidas secas. His characters are complex, nuanced, and tend to have pessimistic world views, from which Ramos deals with topics such as the lust for power (the main theme in São Bernardo), misogyny (a key point in Angústia), and infidelity. His protagonists are mostly lower-class men from northeastern Brazil, which are often aspiring writers (such as in Caetés), or illiterate country workers, all of which usually have to deal with poverty and complex social relations. Like fellow writers Jorge Amado and Erico Verissimo, Ramos was part of Brazil's second generation of modernist writers, in what is known as \"1930s modernism\". A lifelong supporter of communist ideas, he was affiliated with the original Brazilian Communist Party. Life Graciliano Ramos de Oliveira was born in the city of Quebrangulo, in the Brazilian state of Alagoas, on October 27, 1892, to Sebastião Ramos de Oliveira and Maria Amélia Ramos. Graciliano was the oldest of the couple's 16 children. He would spend most part of his childhood travelling through different cities of Northeast Brazil. After finishing high school in Maceió, he became a collaborator of the newspaper Jornal de Alagoas in 1909, where he published a sonnet called \"Céptico\" under the pen name Almeida Cunha, and some other texts under many different pseudonyms. He also published texts in the magazine O Malho, under the pen name Feliciano de Olivença, and founded a short-lived periodical named Echo Viçosense in 1906. In 1914 he moved to Rio de Janeiro, but had to return to Alagoas in September 1915, in order to live with his father, who became a salesman in the city of Palmeira dos Índios. Also in 1915, he married his first wife, Maria Augusta de Barros, having with her four children. Maria Augusta died in 1920, due to troubles during childbirth. In 1927, Ramos was elected mayor of Palmeira dos Índios: he took office in 1928 and would abdicate his post in 1930. Mesmerized by the high literary quality of",

From 1930 to 1936 he lived once again in Maceió. In 1934 he published the novel São Bernardo, and in the following year, he was arrested due to alleged (but never confirmed) participation in the Communist uprising of 1935. (Graciliano wrote an account of his time in prison named Memórias do Cárcere, published a few months after his death in 1953.) After being freed from prison, he publishes with the help of associates such as José Lins do Rego his most famous novel, Angústia. In 1938 he publishes Vidas Secas and moves definitely to Rio de Janeiro, where he became in 1945 a member of the Communist Party of Brazil. In the subsequent years, he travelled alongside his wife to countries such as France, Portugal, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Also in 1945 he published an account of his childhood years, named Infância. Beginning in 1952, Graciliano's health gradually began to decline. He was diagnosed with lung cancer and, after an unsuccessful surgery, died on March 20, 1953. His wife Heloísa would die 46 years later, in Salvador, Bahia.

History In December 2013, eight representatives of the European parliament were on an official visit to Tehran to improve relations between Iran and the European Union. The delegation for relations with Iran was under the leadership of the Finnish politician Tarja Cronberg. A number of different talks and meetings were held, first with Fatmeh Rahbar, a conservative member and Chairman of Women Fraction of the Iranian Parliament and later with human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and film producer Jafar Panahi, both recipients of the Sakharov Prize in 2012. The talks were however criticized by German political figures, including Markus Löning, Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid of the German foreign ministry, due to the ongoing human rights abuses by the Iranian government and continued executions of accused criminals. The last meetings took place six years ago and several previous attempts failed to reinitiate such talks with Iranian officials and representatives of Iranian culture. Serious criticism was also voiced by the American Jewish Committee. Iranian nuclear program The EU supports the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which entered into force on 5 March 1970. Iran ratified this treaty assuring the international community that it will use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. In 2003, it was discovered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that Iran is conducting secret activities with nuclear materials. Iran's refusal to cooperate proactively with the IAEA and its resistance to report to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) led to a diplomatic effort by the European council and its three members France, Germany and the United Kingdom to resolve this issue through negotiations. They were joined in 2004 by the EU High Representative, and thus offering support by all EU members. Subsequently, in 2005 and 2006, extensive proposals to facilitate peaceful nuclear energy usage were again presented to the Iranian authorities. Even with the support of China, Russia and the United States through these proposals, Iran could not be convinced to follow the requests by the IAEA. As a result, four resolutions (N° 1696, 1737, 1747 and 1803) were put in place by the United Nations Security Council: they demanded to suspend all Uranium-235 enrichment and heavy water activities and restricted acquisition of nuclear and ballistic materials by Iran. Those policies were reiterated in 2008 by the EU. The continuing refusal by Iranian authority to make clear declarations and to allow sufficient inspections of their nuclear facilities then convinced the EU to enforce additional sanctions on civilian goods and services such as financial activities and energy sector technologies. In 2012, an oil embargo and restrictive financial boycotts were enforced by the EU, in addition to UN sanctions against Iran. It was not until 8 December 2013, when Iranian authorities based on a historic deal reached in Geneva on 24 November 2013 with the so-called P5+1 group (Britain, China, France, Russia, the United States, and Germany) allowed UN nuclear inspectors to visit a heavy water facility after announcing that plutonium enrichment has been suspended.

Additionally, Iran is required to dilute existing enriched Uranium stockpiles to a concentration of 20%. While the economic boycotts and material restriction are still in place, a step by step reduction of these embargoes by the EU will likely be implemented. In 2015, Iran reached the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement on the Iranian nuclear program in Vienna on 14 July 2015, with the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States—plus Germany), and the European Union. This enabled Iran to normalize its trade relations with the EU. in 2019, United States unilaterally abandoned observing the agreement and unilaterally reimposed sanctions against Iran, which was described by then-British Ambassador to the United States Kim Darroch as \"diplomatic vandalism\". The EU established the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges to bypass the reimposed US sanctions. On May 13, 2022, The European Union said that it felt it had given stalled negotiations to resuscitate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal new life. Trade In 2008, Iranian exports to the EU amounted to €11.3 billion and imports from the EU amounted to €14.1 billion. EU exports to Iran are mainly machinery and transport (54.6%), manufactured goods (16.9%) and chemicals (12.1%). In 2011, Iran ranked 7th in exporting crude oil to Europe and a Eurostat report stated that 27 European states imported 11.4 billion Euros of goods from Iran in the first nine months of 2011. There is significant room for growth, though this is hampered by the nuclear dispute. A Trade and Cooperation Agreement was installed in 2002 but has been on hold since 2005 because of the dispute. There are no bilateral treaties as Iran is not a member of the WTO. On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, a move which was praised by senior Iranian officials as a potential gateway for trade expansion with Europe. European sanctions do not affect Iran's electricity exports, which creates a loophole for Iran's natural gas reserves. At the sixth Iran-Europe Banking and Business Forum in Tehran in April 2018, Iran's outgoing ambassador to Germany Ali Majedi announced that Middle East Bank, Saman Bank, and Sina Bank were planning to open branches in German cities to increase Iran's trade relations with Europe. On 20 October 2018, Association of German Banks stated that exports from Germany to Iran has reduced to 1.8 billion Euros since January.

English local history came to the fore with the antiquarians of the 19th century and was particularly emphasised by the creation of the Victoria County History series in England. Its establishment as a formal academic discipline is usually credited to W. G. Hoskins who also popularised the subject with his book The Making of the English Landscape. History There is incidental material in the writings of Bede which can be used for local history although he wrote a national rather than local history. During the late medieval, travel writers such as John Leland frequently visited and described local antiquities, although once again, these writers did not set out to write local history. The Tudor period saw the publication of national gazetteers (for example Camden) that frequently contained brief local histories. The eighteenth century saw the emergence of county historians such as Nichols and Morant who were arguably the first local historians. These writers took an interest in subjects that are currently unfashionable (such as manorial descents), but often contain important details which can be used by a modern local historian. The nineteenth century saw the widespread publication of parish histories – often written by the local minister. In 1879 Cox published the first edition of his How to Write the History of a Parish that would be used by local historians and genealogists for many years. In 1899, the Victoria County History project began to provide a sound academic basis for local history. The early twentieth century saw individuals in universities with job titles related to local history, but the first department of Local History was established at Leicester in 1947. Interest in local history expanded in the second half of the twentieth century both in numbers and scope. Contemporary researchers gather the conclusions from a wide range of academic disciplines. Researching local history Local history research, like that of family history, is accessible to people without prior historical training or experience. This is because the very nature of local history is such that starting points are always available locally. An intelligent lay researcher can learn the necessary skills as they research. Archivists and societies can provide advice, encouragement, and information; formal courses of study are also widely available. Many local historians are non-specialists whose enthusiasm for history and have applied this",

Most local history researchers follow a process in which they start from the basic facts offered by the available evidence, make a more detailed analysis of that evidence to explore its implications, and then put that analysis in its wider temporal and geographical context. Some take a more theoretical approach: starting from a hypothesis, which they seek to demonstrate or disprove through evidence. Primary sources for local history The survival and availability of local records differ significantly from area to area. West is a good guide to what records may exist and how they might be used. Similarly Iredale also describes where records may be found and how they can be used, although he originally wrote more than thirty years ago and is somewhat dated in parts. There are numerous guides to individual record categories which can be found in bibliographies or referenced in more general works. Secondary sources for local history Where it exists, the appropriate volume of the Victoria County History (VCH) is the best starting point for a locality in England. There is often a local studies library which will contain a wealth of local material. Early county historians, e.g. Philip Morant and his History and Antiquities of Essex, often provide parish by parish accounts, although they frequently include long descriptions of manorial descents which are of little interest to the current generation of historians. If there is a history of the parish church, this may well contain useful material. Further reading Books Celoria, Francis (1958) Teach Yourself Local History.

In September 2018, the U.S Internet advertising market was estimated to be worth $111 billion, with market share being held mostly between Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft. These companies earn revenue through online advertising but also have initiated pathways for individual users and social media influencers to earn an income. Individuals and businesses can earn advertising revenue through advertisement networks such as Google AdSense, YouTube monetization, or Outbrain. Overview There are a variety of methods and providers which individuals and online organizations can use in order to earn monetary income in the form of advertisements accompanying their website or digital media content. Digital technology giants such as Google, Facebook, YouTube, Amazon, and Microsoft allow website owners and content creators to engage in partnerships and display advertisements with their online media; these owners and creators can subsequently receive a share of the advertising revenue. Individuals and organizations can earn significant income through advertising revenue. In 2018, it was reported that major YouTube content creators such as Jake Paul and PewDiePie each earned more than $15 million through monetizing their online video content. Revenue earned by individuals and organizations from online advertisement sources is considered taxable in multiple countries. In 2015, the Australian Taxation Office confirmed questions regarding the tax status of online Ad Revenue stating that it was taxable and content creators should be considered \"performing artists\". Also, in the United States, the Internal Revenue Service deems online ad revenue to be taxable. For those earning income from technology platforms controlled by Alphabet Inc., which includes Google and YouTube, a Form 1099 will be issued by the company if an individual or group earns more than $600 per year. The advertising industry is not without controversy. Ad blocking technology is problematic for companies and individuals looking to earn money by displaying advertisements alongside their content. Ad blocking software is reportedly used by 17% of people aged 18–34 and allows users to block advertisements while visiting a given website, thus removing the possibility that a user will click on a given advertisement. Notable platforms Google Google is one of the largest online advertising platforms in the world. As of March 2019, Google is estimated to facilitate more than 90% of global searches. Since October 2015, Google and its online advertising branches have existed under the structure of an American multinational holding company, Alphabet Inc.

Google and Facebook are reported to control just under 60% of the U.S. online marketing space. A significant part of Google's online advertising platform is Google AdSense, which allows websites to display Google-driven advertisements. As customers click on the advertisements, Google earns revenue from the advertising company, keeping 32% of the revenue while passing on 68% to the participating website. As of January 2018, online advertising accounted for 84% of Alphabet Inc.'s revenue. Google's advertising system provides significant revenue both for itself and for individuals and smaller companies who are actively participating as partners in Google's network. YouTube Another online advertising giant owned by Alphabet Inc. is video sharing website YouTube. In 2006, Google bought YouTube for $1.65 billion. In 2015, Bloomberg estimated YouTube to be worth approximately $70 billion, with over 30 million average daily visitors. YouTube content creators who publish and share their own videos can monetize them. In certain cases, YouTube will pay creators a percentage of the advertising revenue for advertisements that are placed within and before or after videos. The approximate share of advertising revenue paid to the creators of monetized videos is reported to be 55%; in 2013, the average creator's income was estimated to be $7.60 per thousand views. Facebook As of March 2018, Facebook and Google were estimated to hold a combined market share of just under 60% of the U.S. online marketing space. In the last quarter of 2018, Facebook reported an online advertising revenue of $16.9 billion. Facebook allows businesses to advertise throughout its website, using its in-depth knowledge of user demographics and interests to ensure that any given advertisement has a good chance of reaching its specific target audience. Facebook charges a fee for every advertisement click, known as cost per click. Facebook also allows businesses to increase the visibility of their advertisements beyond users who follow or like them; Facebook charges a fee based on the number of people a given advertisement reaches. Facebook grants businesses and individual users the ability to earn money through advertising initiatives. For example, \"Facebook Ad Breaks\" allow users to earn revenue from advertisements that play during their own videos. The videos must be at least three minutes long, with the advertisement not showing until at least the end of the first minute. Early testing of this platform by some users indicates that not all viewers are watching the videos long enough to become monetized viewers; as such, the potential revenue has been deemed low. In 2012, Facebook purchased image-sharing application Instagram for $1 billion. At the time of purchase, Instagram had more than 30 million downloads. As of 2019, Instagram has over 1 billion monthly active users and is estimated to be worth more than $100 billion.

Amazon As of 2018, Amazon was reported to be the third largest online advertising platform and saw predicted advertising revenues sit at above $4 billion. With a reported 197 million unique online visitors per month, Amazon has a wide customer outreach similar to Google and Facebook. Amazon currently allows its users to pay to have their products made more visible on target customer's screens and also allows sellers to act as affiliates, being paid a referral commission of up to 15%. As of May 2019, Amazon is attempting to expand its affiliate advertising program by partnering with other large online media agencies and heavily trafficked websites. Amazon has reportedly reached out to online media giants Buzzfeed and The New York Times with an offer that would see them being paid in order to recommend or advertise products on their site. Such advertisements would include a link to the Amazon page where a potential customer could buy the product and in return, the media agencies would receive a percentage commission of the purchase. On August 25, 2014, Amazon acquired Twitch Interactive for $970 million. On Twitch's live stream platform, advertisements are regularly played on Twitch live streams. Twitch streamers who grow their channels sufficiently can become Twitch Affiliates and Twitch Partners, thereby expanding their revenue avenues. Twitch Partners can earn a share of the revenue from advertisements played to their live audiences and are allowed to \"determine the length and frequency of mid-roll advertisements.\" Microsoft In 2018, Microsoft represented approximately 4% of the estimated $111 billion of the U.S. online advertising market. Microsoft owns search engine Bing, which constitutes over 6% of Internet searches, and social media site LinkedIn. Microsoft earns advertising revenue through programs such as Bing Ads. Businesses and individuals can pay to have their advertisements displayed to customers on each platform. Bing's web publishers program allows website owners to earn advertising revenue by displaying Bing advertisements on their sites. Microsoft also earns ad revenue through its sites. LinkedIn allows individuals and businesses to pay in order to have image and video ads displayed to demographics they wish to target. Each time a LinkedIn user clicks on one of these advertisements, the company is paid between $2–5. LinkedIn has more than 500 million users; in 2018, it was announced that LinkedIn expected to earn approximately $2 billion annually from ads on the platform. Issues Tax implications Revenue earned by individuals and organisations as a result of participating in online advertising programs such as Google AdSense and YouTube monetization may face different income tax requirements based on location.

Specifically related to online advertising income, the Australian Taxation Office stated that any income that an individual receives from online advertising is a reward for providing services based on their activities as a special professional and therefore can form part of the taxpayer's assessable income. In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service also deems online advertising income to be taxable for individuals. For example, those in the United States earning ad revenue from technology platforms controlled by Alphabet Inc. will be issued a 1099 tax form directly by the company if the income is more than $600 per year. Ad blocking Ad blocking refers to the use of various computer applications or programs to remove all online advertisements. This technology can prevent content creators and website owners from earning revenue from those customers who use ad blocking software. One Wall Street Journal survey found that 17% of users aged 18–34 used ad blocking technology and thus prevent any \"pay-per-click\" advertising, as used by the major platforms, to be fully used. There has been support for ad blocking software from major technology companies such as Google. In 2018, Google announced that it would be launching ad blocking type software within its Chrome web browser aimed at targeting websites or advertisements that are designed to disrupt user experience and do not allow for users to dismiss them before a certain time has elapsed. After Google notified potentially impacted websites of the changes, approximately 42% made preemptive changes to ensure that they were compliant with the new advertising user guidelines. Under the current protocol, any site that does not comply with Google's user guidelines will be contacted and given 30 days to resolve the advertising issues before further action is taken Google has announced that its ad blocking technology will be available to users of their search engine without downloading third-party applications or installing any external software.

Its transmitter is located in Apopka. The station currently programs a Haitian Creole-language format known as Radio Nouvelle Lumiere. History Religious WTLN 1520 kHz in Apopka was established as one of the first religious radio stations in central Florida in 1964. Tom Moffit, Sr., a Philadelphia announcer and consultant to preachers, saw an opportunity in a new 1,000-watt station on 1480 kHz, WXIV, owned by an Atlanta preacher, but after delays scuttled the purchase, he instead built WTLN. The call letters represented the four members of Moffit's family: wife, Tom, Linda and Nancy. It originally aired a middle-of-the-road music format with religious programs interspersed. Four years later, WTLN expanded with the launch of WTLN-FM 95.3 in 1968. The FM station offered the then-daytimer the opportunity to broadcast after sunset. WTLN/WTLN-FM continued to operate on a simulcast basis until 1991. At that time, the AM frequency began airing a separate Southern Gospel format as \"1520 The Word\"; the FM continued with its soft contemporary Christian music, and the two stations continued to jointly broadcast selected programs. One of those programs was Central Florida Forum, hosted by Dr. George Crossley; the program moved exclusively to WTLN in 1995. Crossley was arrested in 1996 and convicted the next year after hiring a hitman—in actuality, an undercover federal agent—to kill his former lover's estranged husband; said victim then started a campaign to encourage an advertiser boycott of WTLN. After spending 40 months in prison, Crossley returned to radio at WEUS (810 AM); in 2010 he collapsed while at that station, dying shortly after. WTLN was approved in 1995 to begin nighttime service at its present 350 watts. New call letters, new owner In early 1998, Moffit struck a deal to sell WTLN-FM, which had retained the same owner since 1968, to Cox Radio for $14.3 million and Cox's AM station WZKD (950 AM). The call letters of 1520 AM changed to WHIM on July 1, 1998, airing a traditional Christian music format it called \"Christian heritage radio\"; additionally, the WTLN religious programming moved exclusively to the 950 frequency on January 1, 1999. Alton Rainbow sold WHIM and WTLN after more than 40 years to Salem Communications in a $10 million acquisition in 2005. That same year, Salem acquired WORL (660 AM), giving the company three AM stations in Orlando. In 2010, WHIM changed its call letters to WBZW. Known as \"1520 The Biz\" and later simply as \"1520 WBZW, Your Hometown Station\", the station aired a business news format as well as talk programs of interest to the Apopka area.

Σπᾰρτῐᾱ́ται) or Homoios (pl. Homoioi from respectively Classical- and Ὅμοιοι \"those who are alike\") was an elite full-citizen male of Sparta. Full citizen Spartiates were barred by law from work, and were supported by the other social classes of Spartan society. From a young age, male Spartiates were trained for battle and put through grueling challenges intended to craft them into fearless warriors. In battle, they had the reputation of being the best soldiers in Greece, and the strength of Sparta's hoplite forces let the city become the dominant state in Greece throughout much of the Classical period. Other city-states were reluctant to attack Sparta, even though it could muster a force of only about 8000 Spartiates during the zenith of its dominance. Such was the reputation of its soldiers. Structure of Spartan society Classical Spartan society was rigidly divided into several castes, each with assigned duties and privileges. The smallest of them, with the most power and freedom, was the Spartiate elite. Spartiates were exempt from manual labour and controlled the government of the state. Spartiates men were expected to prepare constantly for military conflict. Besides the Spartiates were the perioeci, literally \"dwellers around\", who were citizens of smaller city-states in Laconia, that were subordinate to Sparta (although it is disputed if this subordination implied in domination) who carried out most of the trade and commerce of the region, since Spartiates were forbidden from engaging in commercial activity. Also were the hypomeiones, literally inferiors, men who were probably although not certainly Spartiates who had lost their social rank. The lowest caste in Spartan society were the helots, subjected populations tied to the land and over whom the Spartan state claimed ownership. In the late 5th century BC and later, a new class, the neodamodeis, literally new damos dwellers, arose and seems to have been composed of liberated helots. Origins According to classical accounts, the Spartan Constitution was the product of a great lawgiver, Lycurgus. He was said to have written the Spartan constitution early in the Archaic period, most likely in the 770s BC. It is impossible to determine whether Lycurgus was an actual historical figure.

That change is likely to have been in some way related to the change from Dark Age warfare, in which nobles were the dominant force, to the hoplite warfare of the classical period. Around the time of that change, Sparta embarked on the conquest of the neighboring state of Messenia. The acquisition of such a comparatively large piece of territory and conquered population seems to have both provided the basis for the system of helotage and required the existence of a large military force to keep the potentially-rebellious Messenians under control. The Spartiates thus became a permanently-armed master class, living off the labour of the helots and preventing rebellion through constant struggle. Spartiate lifestyle During the 6th and the 5th centuries BC, the Spartan system was at its height. In 555 BC, Sparta defeated Tegea and forced that state to become its ally. Around 544 BC, Sparta defeated Argos and established itself as the pre-eminent power in the Peloponnese. For over 150 years, Sparta became the dominant land power of Greece, with the Spartiates hoplites serving as the core of its army. To maintain the social system of the city, it was necessary to have a force ready to oppose any uprising of the helots (that occurred several times in the classical period). To ensure their military readiness, Spartiate youths enrolled in military training (agoge) from the age of seven to thirty, the age of full citizenship. From that age until they became too old to fight, they would live in their barracks, visiting their families (and, later, their wives) only when they could sneak out. Spartiate women, as well, were expected to remain athletically fit since the Spartans believed that strong and healthy parents would produce strong and healthy children. Spartiates were expected to adhere to an ideal of military valour, as exemplified by the poems of Tyrtaeus, who praised men who fell in battle and heaped scorn on those who fled. Each Spartiate male was assigned a plot of land, with the helots that worked it. That was the source of his income since he performed no labour or commerce himself. The primary use of that income was to pay the dues of the communal mess halls to which all Spartiates were required to belong. Any Spartiate who was unable to pay these dues was demoted from his class. Politically, Spartiate males composed the army assembly, the body that elected the ephors, the most powerful magistrates of Sparta after the kings. The Spartiates were also the source of the krypteia, a sort of secret police, which, by measures such as assassination and kidnapping, sought to prevent rebellion among the helots. Decline of Spartiates In the late 5th and the early 4th centuries BC, the Spartiate class gradually shrank in number, along with Spartan military prowess, for several reasons. First was attrition through the increasingly-frequent wars that Sparta found itself embroiled in from the mid-5th century onward. Since Spartiates were required to marry late, birth rates",

Exacerbating that problem was the possibility of demotion from Spartiate status for a number of reasons, such as cowardice in battle and inability to pay for membership in the syssitia. The latter became increasingly severe; as commercial activity began to develop in Sparta, some Spartiates would sell the land from which they were supposed to draw their earnings. Since the constitution included no known provisions for promotion to Spartiate status, the number of Spartiates gradually dwindled. By the mid-4th century BC, the number of Spartiates had been critically reduced although Sparta continued to hold sway over much of Greece. Finally, at Leuctra in 371 BC, a Theban army decisively defeated a Spartan force, killing 400 Spartiates of a force of 700 and breaking the back of Spartan military power. In 370 BC, Messenia was liberated by a Theban army, liberating the helots and destroying the basis of the Spartan social system. The Spartan state never recovered its former power, and the Spartan army, by the later 3rd century, was not particularly superior to other armies in Greece.

The Kingdom of Jórvíc was closely associated with the much longer-lived Kingdom of Dublin throughout this period. History Pre-Viking age York was first recorded by Ptolemy around the year 150 as Eborakon. Under the Romans it became the provincial capital and bishopric of Eburacum. The Roman settlement was regularly planned, well defended and contained a stone legionary fortress. The Romans withdrew around 407 and the Anglo-Saxons occupied the settlement from the early 7th century. Post-Roman York was in the kingdom of Deira, it was taken over in 655 by its northern neighbour Bernicia to form the kingdom of Northumbria.

Viking invasion The Vikings had been raiding the coasts of England from the late 8th century, but in 865 a Viking army landed with the intention of conquering rather than just raiding. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle described the army as the \"mycel heathen here\" (Great Heathen Army). They landed in East Anglia where the locals, under Edmund of East Anglia, \"made peace\" with them in return for horses. The army, led by Ivar the Boneless and his brother Halfdan Ragnarsson, made its way north to Northumbria where the Anglo-Saxons were embroiled in a civil war. In 862 the ruler of Northumbria, Osberht, had been deposed by Ælla of Northumbria. Ivar the Boneless was able to capitalize on the Anglo-Saxons disarray and captured York in 866/ 867. Scandinavian rule 866–901 After Ivar the Boneless had annexed York, the two Anglo-Saxon leaders settled their differences, they joined forces and attempted to retake the city. When the Northumbrians attacked, the Vikings withdrew behind the crumbling Roman city walls, but the Anglo-Saxon leaders were both killed and the Northumbrians defeated during the ensuing battle on 21 March 867. Symeon of Durham wrote: The remaining Northumbrian leaders, probably led by archbishop, Wulfhere, \"made peace\" with the Vikings. The Vikings appointed a compliant native prince Ecgberht as puppet ruler of Northumbria. Five years later, in 872, when the Great Army was elsewhere, the local Northumbrians capitalized on their absence by driving Wulfhere and Ecgberht out. The two exiles found refuge at the court of Burgred of Mercia. The revolt was short lived with the Vikings regaining control of York in 873. Wulfhere was recalled to the See but the Anglo-Saxon Ricsige became ruler, as Ecgberht died in 873. In 875/ 876 part of the Great Army returned, headed by Halfdan Ragnarsson. York was retaken and although Halfdan was proclaimed King of Northumbria, in reality he was only the ruler of southern Northumbria (Deira). Deira became known as the Kingdom of York (Jórvík) with Halfdan as its first king. According to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle: Halfdan's reign did not last long, as he was killed, trying to assert his claim to the Kingdom of Dublin, in 877. There was an interregnum after Halfdan died until Guthred became king in 883. Guthred was the first Christian Viking king of York. It is traditionally thought that Guthreds election was sponsored by Archbishop Wulfhere's religious community from Lindisfarne. Churches and religious centres in Northumbria had been systematically stripped of their wealth since the arrival of the Vikings, however although it had become impoverished the amount of ecclesiastical artefacts that have been excavated in York, from various periods between the 7th and 11th centuries, indicate that the cathedral remained a religious centre throughout. Guthred died in 895 and was buried at York Minster.

Some of the coins discovered have Siefredus's name on providing an indication to when he reigned. The coin evidence suggests that Siefredus succeeded Guthfrith and ruled from about 895 until 900. The medieval chronicler Æthelweard has led some historians to suggest that Siefriedus maybe the same person, as Sichfrith, who had previously been raiding the coast of Wessex. A further hypothesis, proposed by the historian Alfred P. Smyth, is that Siefriedus is the same as the jarl Sichfrith who lay claim to the Kingdom of Dublin in that same year. The Cuerdale Hoard also contained some coins with the name Cnut or Knútr on them, the coin evidence suggests that he reigned between 900 and 905. He is listed as ruler of York but has proved to be something of a conundrum, for historians, as Cnut is not recorded on any written contemporary sources. Historians have posited several hypotheses. These include, \"no coins have been found from Gunfriths reign so perhaps they could be his? \". As some of the coins had both Siefredus and Cnuts name on them \"perhaps these are the same person?\". Another possibility is that he was \"a Danish noble, mentioned in Norse sources, who was assassinated in 902 after a very brief reign.

Following his father's death, in 871, his uncle Alfred the Great became king. When Alfred died in 899. Alfred's son Edward the Elder ascended the throne of Wessex. However, Æthelwold made a bid for power, seizing his fathers old estate in Wimbourne. Edward's forces besieged Æthelwold's position, forcing him to flee. He went to York, where the locals accepted him as king, in 901, even though he was an Anglo-Saxon.According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: Æthelwold did not stay in York long; in 903 he began a campaign to regain the crown of Wessex. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes how he raised a fleet and landed first in Essex, then went on to East Anglia where he persuaded their king Eohric to help him in his campaign. The combined armies raided Wessex in the Cricklade area. Edward and his allies responded by attacking East Anglia. Edward's Kentish allies engaged Æthelwold's army, and in this battle Æthelwold was killed.

It is not clear from the annals, who actually won the battle, but the outcome did allow Ragnall to establish himself as king at York. It seems that the people of York were unhappy with Ragnall as they promised obedience to Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians in early 918, but the negotiations were ended prematurely by her death in June of that year. Late on, in his reign, Ragnall submitted to Edward as overlord, but was allowed to keep his kingdom. Ragnall had three separate issues of coins produced while he ruled York the coins bearing the name RAIENALT, RACNOLDT or similar. He died late in 920 or early 921. The next ruler was Sihtric, who was a kinsman of Ragnall, and another Viking leader that had been expelled from the Kingdom of Dublin, in 902. Sihtric, however had returned to Ireland to retake Dublin and become their king. Then in 920 he travelled to York and joined Ragnall where in 921 Ragnall died and Sihtric replaced him as king. Sihtric raided Davenport, Cheshire, in violation of the terms of submission agreed between Ragnall and Edward. Edward the Elder died in 924. It seems that Sihtric took advantage of the situation to expand his kingdom. There is some numismatic evidence to support this as there are coins, from this time, minted at Lincoln, in the Kingdom of Mercia, as well those from York. Edward was replaced by his son Æthelstan, and although the annals indicated that Sihtric was reluctant to submit to Edward, he submitted to Æthelstan at Tamworth in January 926. Part of the agreement was that Sihtric should marry Æthelstan's sister Eadgyth also he should be baptised. According to Roger of Wendover, Sihtric was baptised but he \"repudiated\" the faith and rejected his bride shortly after, without the marriage being consummated. West Saxon rule 927–939 In 927 Sihtric died. His brother Gofraid left Dublin and headed to Northumbria to replace Sihtric as king, however Gofraid's attempt to rule was unsuccessful, and he was driven out by King Æthelstan. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes no mention of Gofraid, simply stating that Æthelstan succeeded Sihtric as King in Northumbria, and thereafter held a meeting with the other kings in Britain, establishing peace. A later account by William of Malmesbury tells a different story. In his version, Gofraid goes to Scotland following Sihtric's death, to attend a meeting at Dacre with Æthelstan, Constantine II of Scotland, and Owen I of Strathclyde. Gofraid and a Viking ally called Thurfrith led a force to York and besieged the city. Æthelstan counterattacked and Gofraid was captured. The city was then looted by the Anglo-Saxons and Gofraid allowed to return to Ireland. In 937 a coalition of Vikings (led by Gofraid's son Olaf Guthfrithson), Constantine II, King of Scotland, and Owain, King of Strathclyde invaded England.

Restoration of Scandinavian rule 939–944 Although Æthelstan had integrated the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms into one unified England and suppressed opposition from the Vikings and their allies. When he died in 939, the Viking leader Olaf Guthfrithson (who had been defeated at the Brunanburh) was able to travel from Dublin and take over Northumbria with minimal opposition. Coins minted at York during his reign show the Raven motif. In 940, his cousin Olaf Cuaran joined him in York. In 941 Olaf Guthfrithson invaded Mercia and East Anglia The Archbishops of York and Canterbury mediated and Edmund I, Æthelstan's successor, surrendered much of the south-east Midlands and Lincolnshire. It is probable that Olaf Guthfrithson died in 942 and was replaced by Olaf Cuaran. Then in 943 the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that Olaf Cuaran was baptised, with Edmund as sponsor, and that same year, another king of Northumbria, was named as Ragnall Guthfrithson and he was confirmed also with Edmund as sponsor. Both Olaf and Ragnall are called king, but it is uncertain whether they were co-rulers or rival kings. The chronology of events for both Olaf Guthfrithson, Olaf Cuaranths and Ragnalls' reigns have been subject to debate however the annals for 944 all seem to agree that Edmund was able to expel the Viking leaders from Northumbria.

Then according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle he \"granted\" all of Strathclyde, to Malcom king of the Scots in return for an alliance. In 946 Edmund was assassinated at Pucklechurch. Edmund was replaced by Eadred who immediately turned his attention to Northumbria, where according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he \"subdued all Northumberland under his power\" and obtained oaths of obedience from the Scots. In 947 Eadred went to the Anglo-Scandinavian town of Tanshelf, where Archbishop Wulfan and the Northumbrian witan submitted to him. Scandinavian rule reestablished 948–954 Eric Bloodaxe capitalizing on the deteriorating political situation in York, established himself as king.

It is thought that the massacre provoked the king of Denmark, Sweyn Forkbeard, to invade England in 1003. The onslaught continued until 1014 when Æthelred and his family were driven into exile and Sweyn installed as king of England. However he only reigned for five weeks before dying. After Sweyn's death, his son Cnut became the leader of the Danish army and Æthelred returned to England. Æthelred drove Cnut out of England and back to Denmark. Then in 1015, Cnut relaunched the campaign against England. Meanwhile, in 1016 Æthelred died and was succeeded by his son, Edmund Ironside. Edmund and his forces were decisively beaten by Cnut at the Battle of Ashingdon. After the battle, Cnut made a treaty with Edmund whereby Edmund would be king of Wessex and Cnut would rule the rest of England. Ironside died just a few weeks after the treaty.

Siward became the last Scandinavian Earl of Northumbria when he succeeded Erik in about 1033. He governed for 22 years without difficulty. On Siward's death in 1055, the king of England, Edward the Confessor, chose a West Saxon to govern Yorkshire, in place of Siward's son, Waltheof. Edward's choice, Tostig Godwinson, was unpopular with locals. In 1065 Tostig was deposed by the northern nobility and replaced with Morcar (the brother of Edwin of Mercia). The northerners choice of new earl was accepted by Edward. After Edward the Confessor's death in 1065, Harold Godwinson became King of England. He visited York early in his reign and according to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle returned to Westminster at Easter 1066. In September 1066 Tostig was back on the scene this time with his ally, Harold Hardrada of Norway. On the 20 September 1066 the allies defeated, the northern earls, Morcar and Edwin at the Battle of Fulford. The people of York submitted to Tostig and Hardrada who did not occupy the city. Five days later Tostig and Hadrada were defeated and killed, by Harold Godwinson, at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Shortly after William of Normandy landed at Pevensey on 28 September and on 13 October Harold of England fought his last battle on the Sussex coast at Hastings.

When Copsi offered homage to William at Barking in 1067, William rewarded him by making him earl of Northumbria. After just five weeks as earl, Copsi was murdered by Osulf, son of Earl Eadulf III of Bernicia. When, in turn, the usurping Osulf was also killed, his cousin, Cospatrick, bought the earldom from William.

During the winter of 1069, in an action known as the Harrying of the North, he laid waste Yorkshire and eventually replaced its nobility with his own trusted men. The Domesday Book, for Yorkshire, indicates the extent of the Norman takeover, most of the former landowners who survived the conquest, retained only a fraction of their estates, and then as tenants of a Norman lord. With 25 of William the Conquerors magnates holding 90% of the county's manors, the days when English kings appointed Scandinavian Earls of Northumbria were at an end. After the Norman conquest there were several unsuccessful attempts by Scandinavian kings to regain control of England, the last of which took place in 1086. However raiding did continue and the last recorded one was in 1152, when Eystein II of Norway taking avantage of the confusion caused by the English civil war looted places on the east coast of Britain, including Yorkshire. Commerce Coinage Small silver coins, known as sceattas, were minted in England by the early 8th century, and from the late 8th century, locally produced coins of this nature have been excavated in York. The bankrupt nature of the Northumbrian economy is illustrated by the continued production of small silver coins and eventually replacing them with copper pennies (known as stycas) while the other English kingdoms were producing the larger standard silver penny established by Offa of Mercia. The minting of coinage in York was controlled by the Northumbrian monarch and the archbishop.The coins produced under command of the king seems to have stopped around 850 and Archbishop Wulfhere around 855. The Vikings reintroduced the minting of coins, in York, 895/896. These coins had a similar design to continental coins, some with short religious texts on them and others with the name of the mint where they were produced, for example EBRAICE for Eboracum (York). Although where the mint was located, in York has not been identified, a workshop that produced and tested the dies has been identified at Coppergate.

Trade Archaeological evidence indicates that Jórvík had a busy international trade with thriving workshops, and well-established mints. York was part of the wider Scandinavian trading system with one route leading to Norway by way of the Shetland Islands and another to Sweden via the Dnieper and Volga rivers to Byzantium and the Muslim world. York was a major manufacturing centre particularly in metalwork, with Jórvík craftspeople sourcing their raw materials both near and far. There was gold and silver coming from Europe, copper and lead from the Pennines and tin from Cornwall. Also, there was amber from the Baltic for the production of jewellery, and soapstone probably from Norway or Shetland Islands, used to make large cooking pots. Wine was imported from the Rhineland and silk, used to make into caps for sale, came from Byzantium. Religion Christianity had been established in Northumbria by the end of the 7th century. Very little evidence of the old Viking pagan religion in Yorkshire has been found although there is coin evidence minted during Ragnall I's reign, from the 10th century, that had Thor's hammer on them. The arrival of the pagan Vikings seems to have had little effect on the Christian religion, with the incoming Scandinavians converting to Christianity within a few decades of their arrival and largely adopting local burial customs, however there are stone crosses and grave markers, that introduced Scandinavian motifs to the designs and instituted new forms, notably the so-called Hogback gravestone. Hogbacks were introduced in 10th century, they are a house-shaped stone with a bowed roof ridge and often with bombé long sides, many were accompanied by standing crosses. In England, the incidence of them is most dense in northern Yorkshire, suggesting that the form was initiated in this region. Legacy Administration Ridings Scandinavian Yorkshire was divided into three parts, for administration purposes, these were known as the North Riding, the West Riding and the East Riding. The name Riding derives from the Old Scandinavian thrithjungr meaning third part. Under Scandinavian rule each Riding was a unitary authority with its own assemblies. They were created during the Scandinavian period but continued until 1974, when they were abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, although the East Riding of Yorkshire was revived as a unitary authority in 1996.

The term is of Scandinavian origin and meant the taking of weapons; it later signified the clash of arms by which the people assembled in a local court expressed assent.

However, in Yorkshire and northern England there are thousands of words with Scandinavian roots. A contemporary local literary tradition plus the large amount of non-Norman population, indicated by the charters of the time, was the basis of the distinct modern Yorkshire dialect. Placenames After the Norman Conquest, the frequency of Anglo-Scandinavian place-names and the absence of Norman-French place-names indicate that the Norman settlers were purely of the top rank. Place-names can give an indication to what an area was used for. For example, in York, the Old Norse placename Konungsgurtha (Kings Court), recorded in the late fourteenth century was possibly the royal residence. It is in the area immediately outside the site of the porta principalis sinistra, the east gatehouse of the Roman encampment, perpetuated today as King's Square, which nucleates the Ainsty. New streets, lined by regular building fronts for timber houses were added to an enlarging city between 900 and 935, dates arrived at by tree-ring chronology carried out on remaining posts preserved in anaerobic clay subsoil. Many of the city of Yorks street names end in \"~gate\". The name derives from the Old Norse \"~gata\" meaning street. One of the best known of these is Coppergate, which translates as the \"street of the woodworkers\". Archaeological findings From 1976 to 1981, the York Archaeological Trust conducted a five-year excavation in and around the street of Coppergate in central York. This demonstrated that, in the 10th century, Jórvík's trading connections reached to the Byzantine Empire and beyond: a cap made of silk survives, and coins from Samarkand were familiar enough and respected enough for a counterfeit to have passed in trade. Both these items, as well as a large human coprolite known as the Lloyds Bank coprolite, were famously recovered in York a millennium later. Amber from the Baltic is often expected at a Viking site and at Jórvík an impractical and presumably symbolic axehead of amber was found. A cowrie shell indicates contact with the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf.

After graduating with distinction from the KU Leuven (Belgium) in Electrical and Nuclear Engineering, Bastiaens served in the military from 1971 to 1972. In 1972 he joined the Hi-Fi division of Philips Electronics in Leuven, where he served in various management capacities until 1982. During his earlier years there he created a number of new production methods, including for the assembly of loudspeaker systems, manufacturing of tuners and component insertion in printed circuit boards. By introducing new strategies including CAD/CAM, he was later able to reduce the development time of Hi-Fi components from 18 months to nine. In 1983 Bastiaens was promoted to the Philips headquarters in Eindhoven where he became a general manager and director with worldwide responsibility for the Compact Disc project. Between 1983 and 1986 he oversaw a multi-divisional engineering effort the bring the cost of a compact disc player from 1150 Dutch guilders down to 220. The project was internally called \"25–250\": By reducing the cost of key components such as the laser module, the drive unit, the decoding circuit, etc. to 25 guilders each, the target was to enable Philips to build the product for 250 guilders. Bastiaens then concentrated on selling OEM licenses for the CD technology as well as maintaining a global market share of 20 percent in Compact Disc mechanisms for Philips. He was also responsible of diversification efforts such as CD-ROM and CD-ROM XA. From 1988–92 Bastiaens was general manager and director of the Multimedia Division of Philips Consumer Electronics. Jan Timmer, then Philips' head of Consumer Electronics, gave him four months to make or break the Compact Disc Interactive (CD-I) project, a joint effort between Sony and Philips to enhance the CD standard with multi-media technology. This so-called \"Green Book\" standard had been in development since 1985 but was still in the concept phase when Bastiaens took charge. He started out by changing the project to \"full motion video\", which would enable a CD-I disc to hold a full-length feature movie but was rather ambitious at the time, as the compression and decoding hard- and software had yet to be developed. The success of the project also hinged on the creation of software and tools to create the content which would be essential in driving the market. Bastiaens moved the project into the MPEG standard, getting Philips more actively involved in that technology. By the time the first CD-I products where launched in 1992, using the MPEG-1 standard for video, development of MPEG-2 technology was well under way for the upcoming DVD technology, which used a red laser for encoding more than eleven times as much information on a disk of the same size as a CD, which used a yellow laser. In 1992 Bastiaens was approached by Apple CEO John Sculley to move to Apple Computer as a vice president, and the first General Manager of Apple's newly formed Personal Interactive Electronics (PIE) division in the early 1990s.

Born in Fife as one of nine children, Daly's father Jimmy was a miner and a founder member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), who suffered blacklisting due to his activities during the 1926 general strike. Jimmy was of Irish Catholic extraction whilst Lawrence's mother Janet was a Presbyterian. Lawrence was educated at local Catholic schools: he later said that his education had left him with both a considerable knowledge of Scottish poetry and \"a need for a strongly authoritative dogma\". He subsequently pursued adult education through correspondence courses organised by the National Council of Labour Colleges. At 15, Lawrence Daly began work as a miner at Glencraig Colliery. At this time he also joined the Young Communist League. Daly was soon active in the Scottish Mineworkers' Union. His initial involvement was in the labour movement's youth wing; amongst other activities he represented the British Trades Union Congress (TUC) on an international youth delegation to Moscow in 1945. He wrote a pamphlet on the visit titled A Young Miner Sees Russia, which was published the following year. He also attended the 1945 World Youth Conference in London as a delegate, where he met his future wife, Renee, who attended as a delegate from Worcestershire Youth Clubs. He was chair of the Scottish TUC's Youth Committee, and later was elected chair of the Scottish Youth Committee of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).

Despite these differences, in 1951 Daly spent some time as full-time party agent in West Fife. He eventually left the Party in 1956, shortly before the mass exodus of membership over the Soviet invasion of Hungary. He became associated with the formation of the \"New Left\", in its journals New Reasoner and later the New Left Review. In 1957, Daly helped to found the Fife Socialist League. He joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament the same year. He was elected as a County Councillor for the Ballingry division in May 1958, and at the 1959 general election, he took 10.7% of the vote in West Fife, easily beating the CPGB candidate. When the FSL disbanded in 1964, Daly joined the Labour Party. In the late 1960s Daly served as a member of the Russell Tribunal which investigated alleged war crimes committed by the United States in the Vietnam War. Daly rose through the NUM ranks. He was elected to the National Union of Mineworkers Scottish Area Executive Committee in 1962, became the full-time agent for the Fife, Clackmannan and Stirling District a year later, and then General Secretary of the Scottish Area NUM in 1965. Daly was part of the movement in the mid-1960s for the abolition of piecework at the coalface, and its replacement by a national day wage structure— the National Power Loading Agreement (NPLA) of 1966. In 1968, Daly was elected General Secretary of the NUM, and following what had by then almost become a tradition in the NUM, worked with two moderate Presidents, Sidney Ford and Joe Gormley. As a result of his election he moved from Scotland to London to base himself at the union's headquarters on Euston Road. He steered the union through two major strikes in 1972 and 1974. Both strikes were a response to a massive falling behind of miners wages generally, and of coalface workers wages particularly; these occasioned by the effects of the \"standstill\" clauses in the NPLA, where the highest paid colliers in the Midlands and Nottinghamshire gave up any real pay increases as they waited until faceworkers' shift rates in Scotland, Wales and other areas caught up. Following the 1974 strike, Prime Minister Edward Heath called a general election over the issue of \"who governs Britain\". He lost, although his successor as leader of the Conservative Party successfully all but destroyed the NUM little over ten years later. Daly sustained a serious injury in a road accident in 1975, in which his brother and sister-in-law were killed, and had prolonged leave of absence following it. He was succeeded as NUM General Secretary by Peter Heathfield from the Derbyshire Area in 1984. Following his retirement he settled in Berkhamsted, before spending the last ten years of his life in a nursing home in Luton.

The locomotive type is operated by private rail operators in Germany and Austria. In addition, a large order from the Swiss Federal Railway resulted in a variation of the locomotive, designated Am843, now also operated by other rail companies in Switzerland; this variant represents the majority of the locomotives of this type produced. Locomotives equipped with a Caterpillar engine are sometimes referred to by the sub classification G1700-2. Background, design and history The design is based on the MaK G1206, the first locomotive was built with a 1.5 MW MTU 12V4000 engine, a later version first presented at the 2002 InnoTrans was longer, with a raised engine centre section with a 45° edge chamfer to accommodate a larger 1.7 MW CAT 3512B engine. The lower powered 1.5MW MTU engined version did not remain in production; later orders for this power range being fulfilled by the already numerous G1206. The design resulted in an order from the Swiss Federal Railways for 59 G1700 type locomotives with a CAT 3512B engine rated to 1.5 MW. The Swiss design specified very low emissions, and to comply with this requirement versions of the G1700 built for Switzerland have a diesel particulate filter built in. Operators 1.5 MW MTU engined G1700 Six of the MTU engined versions were built between 2001 and 2003, the transmissions were Voith L5r4zU2 as used on most of the G1206 locomotives.

Importance of Selma to the Confederacy Because of its central location, production facilities, and rail connections, the advantages of Selma as a site for production of cartridges, saltpeter, powder, shot and shell, rifles, cannon and steam rams soon became apparent to the Confederacy. By 1863, most materiel was manufactured in Selma, employing at least ten thousand people. Selma, along with the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, was one of two sites",

CSS Nashville was also partially outfitted in Selma. Early Federal attempts to seize Selma The capacities and importance of Selma, in its relation to the Confederate war effort, had been evident to Northern strategists and too great to be overlooked by the Federal authorities as early as 1862. But reaching it with a Federal force was not attempted early in the war, as its distance from the front lines made it an extremely difficult target. As Selma grew in importance to the Confederate forces, the greater became the necessity to capture it. Brigadier General Benjamin Grierson, with a cavalry force from Memphis, was intercepted and returned in 1863. Major General William Tecumseh Sherman made an effort to reach it in February 1864, but after advancing as far as Meridian, within of Selma, he retreated to the Mississippi River. General Lovell Rousseau made a dash in the direction of Selma in 1864, but was misled by his guides and instead struck east of the city. Battle of Selma Major General James H. Wilson detached Brig. Gen. John T. Croxton's brigade to destroy all Confederate property at Tuscaloosa, Alabama. After capturing a Confederate courier who carried dispatches from General Nathan Bedford Forrest describing the strengths and dispositions of his scattered forces, Wilson also sent a brigade to destroy the bridge across the Cahaba River at Centreville. This action effectively cut off most of Forrest's reinforcements. This began a running fight that did not end until after the fall of Selma. On the afternoon of April 1, 1865, after skirmishing all morning, Wilson's advanced guard ran into Forrest's line of battle at Ebenezer Church, where the Randolph Road intersected the main Selma road. Here Forrest had hoped to bring his entire force to bear on Wilson. However delays caused by flooding plus earlier contact with the enemy enabled Forrest to muster less than 2,000 men, a large number of whom were not veterans but militia consisting of old men and young boys. The outnumbered and outgunned Confederates fought for more than an hour as more Union cavalry and artillery deployed on the field. Forrest himself was wounded by a saber-wielding Union captain whom he killed with his revolver. Finally, a Union cavalry charge with carbines blazing broke the Confederate militia causing Forrest to be flanked on his right. He was forced to retreat under severe pressure. Early the next morning Forrest arrived at Selma, \"horse and rider covered in blood.\" He advised Gen. Richard Taylor, departmental commander, to leave the city. Taylor did so after giving Forrest command of the defense. Selma was protected by three miles of fortifications which ran in a semicircle around the city. They were anchored on the north and south by the Alabama River. The works had been built two years earlier, and while neglected for the most part",

In front of this was a picket fence of heavy posts planted in the ground, high, and sharpened at the top. At prominent positions, earthen forts were built with artillery in position to cover the ground over which an assault would have to be made. Forrest's defenders consisted of his Tennessee escort company, McCullough's Missouri Regiment, Crossland's Kentucky Brigade, Roddey's Alabama Brigade, Frank Armstrong's Mississippi Brigade, General Daniel W. Adams' state reserves, and the citizens of Selma who were \"volunteered\" to man the works. Altogether this force numbered less than 4,000, only half of who were dependable. The Selma fortifications were built to be defended by 20,000 men. Forrest's soldiers had to stand 10 to apart in the works. Wilson's force arrived in front of the Selma fortifications at 2 p.m. He had placed Gen. Eli Long's division across the Summerfield Road with the Chicago Board of Trade Battery in support. He had Maj. Gen. Emory Upton's division placed across the Range Line Road with Battery I, 4th U.S. Artillery in support. Altogether, Wilson had 9,000 troops available for the assault. The Federal commander's plan was for Upton to send in a 300-man detachment after dark to cross the swamp on the Confederate right, enter the works, and begin a flanking movement toward the center moving along the line of fortifications. Then, a single gun from Upton's artillery would signal the attack by the entire Federal Corps. At 5 p.m., however, Gen. Long's ammunition train in the rear was attacked by advance elements of Forrest's scattered forces coming toward Selma. Both Long and Upton had positioned significant numbers of troops in their rear for just such an event. However, Long decided to commence his assault against the Selma fortifications to neutralize the enemy attack in his rear. Long's troops attacked in a single rank in three main lines, dismounted with Spencers carbines blazing, supported by their own artillery fire. The Confederates replied with heavy small arms and artillery fire of their own. The Southern artillery, in one of the many ironies of the Civil War, only had solid shot on hand, while just a short distance away was an arsenal which produced tons of canister, a highly effective anti-personnel ammunition. The Federals suffered many casualties (including General Long himself) but not enough to break up the attack. Once the Union Army reached the works, there was vicious hand-to-hand fighting. Many soldiers were struck down with clubbed muskets. But, in less than 30 minutes, Long's men had captured the works protecting the Summerfield Road. Meanwhile, General Upton, observing Long's success, ordered his division forward. The story was much the same for his men as on Long's front. Soon, U.S. flags could be seen waving over the works from Range Line Road to Summerfield Road.

Mixed units of Confederate troops had also occupied the Selma railroad depot and the adjoining banks of the railroad bed to make a stand next to the Plantersville Road (present day Broad Street). The fighting there was heavy, but by 7 p.m., the superior numbers of Union troops had managed to flank the Southern positions causing them to abandon the depot as well as the inner line of works. In the darkness, the Union rounded up hundreds of prisoners, but hundreds more escaped down the Burnsville Road, including Generals Forrest, Armstrong, and Roddey. To the west, many Confederate soldiers fought the pursuing Union soldiers all the way down to the eastern side of Valley Creek. They escaped in the darkness by swimming across the Alabama River near the mouth of Valley Creek (where the present day Battle of Selma Reenactment is held.) The Union soldiers looted the city that night while many businesses and private residences were burned. They spent the next week destroying the arsenal and naval foundry. Then they left Selma heading to Montgomery.

Location The population of Baependi as of 2020 was estimated to be 19,199 people living at an altitude of 893 meters. The area of the municipality is 751.748 km². The city belongs to the mesoregion of Sul e Sudoeste de Minas and to the microregion of São Lourenço. The municipality contains 39.93% of the Serra do Papagaio State Park, created in 1998. Toponym \"Baependi\" is derived from the tupi language and means \"water of the flattened thing\"; mba'e (\"thing\"), peb (\"flattened\") and 'y (\"water or river\"). Another theory says that the name comes from the tupi mbaé-pindi, meaning \"open glade\". History According to some reports, mining occurred in the southern region from 1601. The conquest of Baependi happened, however, at the end of the seventeenth century, around 1692, when the Paulistas Antonio Delgado da Veiga, his son Joao da Veiga and uncle Miguel Garcia and Captain Manoel Garcia Velho, started from Taubaté in search of gold. Crossing the Serra da Mantiqueira, they reached a site called maependi (mbaé-pindi means \"open clearing\" in Tupi-guarani). The city is a remnant of the so-called cycle of Gold in Minas Gerais. Baependi developed along the Estrada Real - the first major means of regular communication in Brazil which linked the mines to the port of Paraty in Rio de Janeiro from where gold was shipped to Europe. The Madeiran Tomé Rodrigues Nogueira do Ó (1715), Captain-mor and Ombudsman of Quintos the \"registration of the Mantiqueira\" was one of the first residents of the site and is considered the founder of the city as the first builder. Mining was, gradually, replaced by agriculture and cattle breeding. It had a large tobacco plantation, which made Baependi the centre of production of the Province of Minas Gerais and represented a major source of wealth until the mid-nineteenth century.

It is the first and only original entry to be developed by Felistella and published by Bandai Namco Games, following original developer, Flight-Plan's, closure in 2010, and original publisher Banpresto being acquired by Bandai Namco. The game was released in Japan on May 16, 2013 for the PlayStation Portable. Almost two years after its initial Japan release, in April 2015, Gaijinworks announced that they would publish the game in English in North America and Europe sometime in 2015. It was released digitally in North America on December 15, 2015, and received a limited-edition physical release on April 7, 2016. The game was considered a success in English regions, with its sales being enough to warrant Gaijinworks to translate its sequel, Summon Night 6, which was released in 2017. Gameplay Similar to the past main numbered entries in the series, the game is played as a tactical role-playing game with elements of a visual novel. The game involves the player moving characters in a turn based fashion across a large grid from an adjustable isometric perspective. At the beginning of the game, the player can choose to play as either a male or female protagonist, and chose from 4 separate \"Cross\" (partner) characters. Which combinations are selected affect both the dialogue and story progression, leading to eight separate paths to take through the game. As in most tactical RPGs, the goal is for the player to strategically move their characters across the grid, to defeat the AI-controlled opponent's team of characters. This is generally done by moving characters in certain positions to attack the opposing character. Attacks take away from a character hit points, losing",

In addition to this general flow of battle, the game also uses the \"Brave Battle System\". A player's team contains a numerical \"Brave Points\" value that represents the team's morale for the fight. When bad actions occur, such as a character of the player dying, brave points are lost, and if they drop to zero, the battle is over and lost. Conversely, by carrying out certain positive actions, such as fulfilling \"brave conditions\", such as being the first to initiate an attack, or defeating a certain number of a certain enemy type, results in gaining more brave points. Successfully completing brave conditions may also result in gaining \"brave medals\", which in turn can be used to purchase new attacks and abilities for characters to use in future battles. Plot The game's story takes place 200 to 300 years after the events of Summon Night 3, in an alternate parallel dimension, and contains references to the past game's world and characters. The game follows one of two main protagonists, determined by the player's selection: Folth, the male character, who has a \"gun-arm\" that shoots out \"energy-hands\", or Arca, the female character, who uses a pole arm as a weapon. The player may also choose one of four \"Cross characters\" to partner their selected protagonist with, with different combinations leading to different weapons and abilities becoming available. Each character is from each of one of the game's four worlds; Pariet from the Phantom Beast World, Kagero is from the Ogre world, Spinel is from the Spirit World, and Dyth is from the Machine World. Development In 2010, Summon Night series developer Flight-Plan closed down, leaving the future of the series in question. While the rights were transferred to Banpresto, which in turn transferred to Bandai Namco, the game's official community website proceeded to be taken off-line afterwards in 2011. However, in July 2012, Bandai Namco Games announced that not only would they be re-releasing the first four titles in the main series of games, but also creating a fifth entry in the series, all on the PlayStation Portable. In order to build up excitement and demand for the fifth entry, Bandai Namco would release Summon Night and Summon Night 2 as PlayStation Classics (playable on PSPs), and release Summon Night 3 and Summon Night 4 as enhanced remakes. Summon Night 5 itself was first announced in an issue of V Jump magazine, with more details being revealed later in the month.

Christianson (January 24, 1925 – September 29, 1950) was a Marine Corps private first class who posthumously received the Medal of Honor for giving his life in a one-man stand against a ferocious attack which threatened to destroy his platoon in Korea on September 29, 1950. The nation's highest tribute for gallantry was presented to his parents by Secretary of the Navy Dan A. Kimball in Washington, D.C., on August 30, 1951. The Medal of Honor was PFC Christianson's second decoration in 16 days of fighting in Korea. Just 11 days before he was killed, he was awarded the Bronze Star for another act of valor. The 25-year-old veteran of almost eight years in the Marine Corps also had been awarded a Letter of Commendation for meritorious service in the Pacific during World War II. Biography Born January 24, 1925, in Mindoro, Wisconsin, Stanley Reuben Christianson attended school in La Crosse County, Wisconsin, and farmed for a time before enlisting in the Marine Corps Reserve on October 2, 1942, at the age of 17. Following recruit training at San Diego, California, Christianson took advanced training with the 2nd Marine Division and went overseas with that outfit. He fought at Tarawa, Saipan, Tinian, and Okinawa, and served with the occupation forces in Japan. Discharged in December 1945, PFC Christianson re-enlisted in the regular Marine Corps three months later. He served at the Naval Air Station Pensacola Florida; as a Drill Instructor at Parris Island, South Carolina; at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Hastings, Nebraska; at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Brooklyn, New York; and at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, before going overseas to Korea with the 1st Marine Division in August 1950. After participating in the Inchon landing, he earned the Bronze Star Medal on September 18, 1950. The citation said Private First Class Christianson, acting as an automatic rifleman during an assault, \"fearlessly and courageously exposed himself to find the exact location of the enemy.\" Eleven days later, PFC Christianson was killed near Seoul during the UN September 1950 counteroffensive.

Formerly, some authorities referred to this species as the crested hawk-eagle, a name that may cause some confusion as it is more commonly used for an Asian eagle species. Like all eagles, it is in the family Accipitridae. This species has a feathered tarsus that marks it as a member of the Aquilinae or booted eagle subfamily. This species is notable for the vivid colors and bold markings of adults, which differ considerably from the far more whitish plumage of the juvenile bird. The ornate hawk-eagle ranges from central Mexico south through much of Central America and in a somewhat spotty but broad overall range into South America, including in the west apart from the Andes and broadly on the Atlantic side especially Brazil down to as far as Southeast Brazil and northern Argentina. This species is found largely in primary forests with tall trees, although can be found in many forest types. The ornate hawk-eagle female lays almost always a single egg and the species has a fairly prolonged breeding cycle like many tropical raptors, especially due to a lengthy post-fledging stage on which juveniles are dependent on their parents. It is a diversified and exceptionally powerful predator which takes a range of prey, usually various medium-to-large-sized birds and small-to-medium-sized mammals as well as occasional reptiles. Like many forest-dependent raptors, especially those in the tropical and subtropical regions, this species is likely under the pressing threat of deforestation. The decline of forest habitat in this species range, especially the Amazon rainforest, led the IUCN to uplist the ornate hawk-eagle as Near Threatened in 2016.

It is one of four living members of the Spizaetus species of \"hawk-eagle\" native to the neotropics. At one time Old World hawk-eagles, native to various southern areas of Asia, were also included in the Spizaetus genus. However, genetic studies have shown the Asian group of species to be paraphyletic, resulting in the Old World members being placed in Nisaetus (Hodgson, 1836) and separated from the New World species. The history of the American Spizaetus genus has been indicated by the diversity of hawk-eagles found in the fossil records in the United States and Mexico. At least five such species have been described, having presumably radiated from basal hawk-eagles of Asian origin across the Bering Land Bridge. Studies have indicated that some of these are ancestors of modern Spizaetus species, with the genera having been present in North America at least since the Pliocene. Some forms were considerably more massive than any extant hawk-eagle and indeed were likely to have exceeded the size of any living booted eagle. Fossil species such as Spizaetus willetti may have grown to similar sizes as the modern harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja). Studies based on the genetic markers indicated the black-and-white hawk-eagle (Spizaetus melanoleucus) and, especially, the black-and-chestnut eagle (Spizaetus isidori) are closely related to the ornate hawk-eagle, resulting in their respective former genera of Spizastur and Oroaetus being eliminated. The fourth neotropical hawk-eagle, the black hawk-eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus), has been found to be basal to the other extant species. Per genetic research, the ornate hawk-eagle and black-and-chestnut eagle are considered as sister species. The ornate hawk-eagle has been diagnosed to include two subspecies. The nominate subspecies (S. o. ornatus) occupies a good deal of the South American range of the species, including eastern Colombia, Venezuela and all of the species range in Brazil and points south. The second subspecies, S. o. vicarius, has been described to inhabit the discontinuous northern part of the range, extending from Mexico and Central America down through much of western Colombia and western Ecuador down as far south as El Oro. The subspecies seem to differ mostly in the plumage characteristics of adults. Whereas nominate birds are a more cinnamon-hued color on the neck with slightly paler ground color and sparser markings about the head and undersides, S. o. vicarius, tends to be darker overall, with a richer, deeper more rufous color around the neck, denser and darker markings overall and broader bands on the tail. Description This is a medium-to-large sized species of raptor but a fairly small eagle. In the ornate hawk-eagle, the sexes are similar in appearance and overlap in size but like most birds of prey do show reverse sexual dimorphism, in which females outsize males to the contrary of most non-raptorial birds. The biggest female ornate hawk-eagles are 13% larger than biggest males, with an average of about 8% greater in nominate race. In Central America, in extreme cases, the largest females",

Ornate hawk-eagles largely perch within the tree canopy, but will sometimes be out on exposed branches especially earlier in the morning. Usually soaring activity peaks in the late morning. Brown & Amadon (1986) described the species are \"rather stolid and buteonine, despite the long tail and crest\". Adults are largely distinguishable by their rufous cowls and bold barring below. Furthermore, all ornate hawk-eagles bear a long erectile crest, which may variously be laid flat against the head, protrude straight up like a spike or sometimes hang at a slight curve. Adults when perched have an obvious black crown, crest and malar stripes (continuing to sides as isolated streaks) sets off by the rufous color on their cheeks, ear-coverts and sides of the neck and chest (sometimes completely covering their upper chests), the rufous shading into a somewhat browner rufous nape. On the upperside, they are barred blackish to dark brown with usually apparent white tips on the mantle and lesser wing coverts. Meanwhile, on the underside, they have a whitish base color which, other than the often plain throat, is boldly overlaid with black barring. This barring extends down to the abdomen and legs, while the crissum is spotted black. Like many forest raptors, the species has relatively short wings and a longish tail. When perched, their wing tips slightly exceed their tail base. The tail is blackish with a creamy whitish tip and three broad pale bands, which are greyish",

According to Brown & Amadon \"the perched bird seemingly has legs set very far forward, almost under the chest, thus giving the impression of posed readiness. The position of the black crest hints at the bird's temper at the moment\". Juvenile differ conspicuously in many respects, generally lacking most of the pigment visible in adults. Juveniles lack the adults' rufous collar, malar stripes and underside barring. Instead, the juvenile's whole head and underparts are white excepting thin black streaks on the crown and the tip of their crest. Some juvenile ornate hawk-eagles do, however, show variable, light dark brown barring and spotting on the flanks and thighs, at even may manifest a vestigial moustache on the face. The juvenile's back and wings are dark brown with white-tipped blackish shoulders. The tail is somewhat similar to the adult's but has a broader white tip and at least 4-5 thinner bands, which like those of the adult are greyish above and whitish below. By their 2nd year, the young hawk-eagles enter an intermediate or subadult plumage that quickly starts to resemble that of the adults but is rather more faded in appearance. The subadult's face is a sandy to pale rufous color with an indistinct malar stripe, while the flanks, belly and legs increasingly start to manifest barring and spotting. The subadult's back is still largely dark brown but tends to appear increasingly blackish. Adults have orangish-yellow eyes, with a dull greenish to grey color on the cere and bare lores, while the feet are rich cream to pale yellow. Juveniles have white to whitish-yellow eyes, a yellow to bluish-grey cere and brighter yellow to orange feet. Apparently, the legs of juveniles are often less thickly feathered than those of adults. In flight it may appear intermediate in size, being large relative to most forest raptors but rather small and slender-bodied for an eagle. The flying ornate hawk-eagle is prominent headed with short, broad rounded wings that show an emphasis on the bulging secondaries and pinch in at the bases of the trailing edges. Flight of the species is deep and powerful with the wings held flattish and pressed slightly forward, while the tail may be closed to slightly spread. From above, adult has a rufous cowl, a blackish mantle and a slightly brownish black back and wings with white-tipped shoulders and tail coverts. Below the underwing is paler looking relative to body with flecking or speckling only on the hand and thinly barred flight feathers. In flight, the juvenile ornate hawk-eagle is mainly dark brown above with whitish scaled blackish-brown shoulders. Below, the juvenile's wings have scattered spots on the axillaries and great wing-coverts, blackish tips to the white based outer primaries and thin barring on the other flight feathers, at times matching the patterning of the tail.

Confusion species While adult ornate hawk-eagles are obviously distinctly marked from most other raptors, one species strikingly resembles this predator, the juvenile of the gray-bellied hawk (Accipiter poliogaster) which is extremely different looking from the respective plumage of adult gray-bellieds. While not definitely proven, this is quite possibly a case of mimicry, as is known in other raptor assemblages wherein a less powerful species (the hawk) mimics a more powerful species (the hawk-eagle) presumably to mitigate potential predatory attacks. Distant gray-bellied hawks are best told apart by their very different proportions and build both in flight and perched. The gray-bellied hawks are typical of an Accipiter, having broader and much shorter wings, relatively more elongated tail and signature flap-flap-glide flight style. Although the gray-bellied hawk is by a slight margin the largest member of that genus in South America, it is still considerably smaller than the hawk-eagle, averaging about a third smaller in length. At close range, it may noticeably differ, beyond the size discrepancy, by the hawk being crestless and bearing relatively long, featherless and yellow legs. Black hawk-eagles are fairly similarly shaped and similarly sized as the ornate hawk-eagle when seen in flight but are slightly larger in appearance, being longer tailed and longer winged. Nonetheless, the ornate hawk-eagle usually is slightly heavier on average than the black hawk-eagle and may appear chestier in perched birds than the more gracile black species. Confusion with the adult black hawk-eagle is unlikely given that it is always much darker, appear solidly soot colored apart from its heavily barred wings. Juveniles and late first years stages of the black hawk-eagle are most likely to be confused in distant flight with perhaps a subadult ornate, however the juvenile black hawk-eagle is always much more heavily barred below with dark cheeks separating the white supericilia and throat. Haverschmidt (1968) mentioned a \"dark morph\" of the ornate hawk-eagle that he said was \"nearly impossible\" to distinguish from the black hawk-eagle but this is considered most likely to have been a misidentified black hawk-eagle in intermediate plumage. The juvenile ornate hawk-eagle is potentially confusable with the black-and-white hawk-eagle but the latter is smaller with boxier wings, shorter crest, a bold orange cere, a strong black mask and a blacker upper-body with white leading edges. Also the black-and-white bears no spots or barring on its wings and has a plain white underbody. The black-and-white species is more similar to an Accipiter in proportions than the ornate species, having relatively less expansive wings and somewhat more elongated looking tail. Juveniles are told from the similar juvenile black-and-chestnut eagle by their smaller size and by having more extensive spots and barring on the under wing (giving the differences in altitudinal range, overlap in distribution is likely very minimal). Juvenile hook-billed kite (Chondrohierax uncinatus) are also potentially confusable with juvenile ornates but the kite is much smaller and more dumpily built with more paddle-shaped wings, a squarer tail, with clearer bars on remiges and rectrices and bare tarsi.

Pale juvenile crested eagles (Morphnus guianensis) appear much larger and longer tailed than juvenile ornate hawk-eagles with dark grey rather than dark brown backs, unbarred flanks and have a less marked hand in flight contrasting with more boldly barred primary quills. Despite the ornate species not infrequently being described as “slim”, in actuality, the much bigger-looking crested eagle is much lighter for its size and only averages about 30% heavier than the ornate (other eagle species around the same total length as the crested eagle weigh about three times as much as the ornate species). Despite its somewhat similar plumage and appearance to the crested eagle, the harpy eagle is far more massive than the ornate hawk-eagle (nearly five times heavier on average) and unlikely to be confused with any plumage of the smaller species. Vocalization The main call known for the ornate hawk-eagle is a series of loud piping whistles. It is emitted by the soaring bird, usually male, and is often transcribed as , the repeated anywhere from 2 to 9 times. Numerous variations are known are given in terms of transcription but most sources describe in roughly similar ways. Unlike the call of the black hawk-eagle, similarly done in flying display, the ornate hawk-eagle the introductory series of notes is more hurried and the last note more drawn out. It has been noted by some authors that the ornate species' call in nearly a reverse of the pattern of the calling black hawk-eagle which calls , the first note being longest and slurred, second note highest, followed by descending short notes. While perched, ornate hawk-eagle may let out a followed by an accelerating series of excited sounding laughing notes. Other reported call include a reminiscent of a limpkin (Aramus guarauna) call and a cat-like scream when disturbed. Perched juveniles have a food begging call consisting of a loud, clear whistle, which is repeatedly irregularly and transcribed aswheeu or wheee. While nesting, the male when arriving with food announces his presence with a pitpit call repeated four times. The most common form of call by the female is emitted during food begging, a note, which is usually repeated about four times. She may also call out a sharp when being mobbed by small birds. A further call was once attributed to an ornate hawk-eagle that was hunting a guan was a very deep growl, reminiscent of a big cat, to such a degree that the witnesses initially thought the guan was being pursued by a jaguar (Panthera onca).

Range and habitat The ornate hawk-eagle has the largest distribution of the nine species of eagle endemic to the neotropics, ranging over an estimated 20.2 million square kilometers in total. This is a largely sedentary species, but some local dispersal is known to occur and individuals wander into drier forest and higher altitudes than normal. The species ranges as far north as southeastern Mexico, where it is found on the Caribbean slope from southern Tamaulipas, on Pacific more infrequently in Jalisco and east Oaxaca. In their Mexican range, their status is uncertain in Colima, where it may be extirpated. Reportage of the species is known in the Mexican states of Guerrero and Nayarit but these could pertain to wandering individuals. Nesting remains unconfirmed throughout west Mexico and since most birds seen are juveniles, these could refer to post-dispersal wanderers. The species is found almost continuously through Central America in Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua into Costa Rica and Panama (including the isle of Coiba). In Panama, it is much more numerous on the more humid Caribbean side than the drier slopes of the Pacific, being especially scarce in the Panama canal zone and Azuero Peninsula, but can occur in more humid parts of the Pacific side. A similar distributional favoring of the more humid Caribbean coast has been noted elsewhere in Central America as well. In South America, the range continues locally west of the Andes (formerly at least to tropical western Ecuador), being somewhat more commonly found north and east of the Andes in Colombia, northern and central Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, eastern Ecuador and the Guianas. In Brazil, it occupies nearly two-thirds of the large country south to Paraná and marginally into Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul but is largely (if not entirely) absent from Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais and more or less the entirety of the northeast region. Their distribution continues through eastern Peru, northern, central and eastern Bolivia, southern Paraguay and northwestern (down to Tucumán) and northeastern Argentina (down to Santa Fe), though it has been wondered if the northeast occurrences are merely incidental wanderings of juveniles from adjacent populations. Despite its wide distribution, the species is frequently quite uncommon to increasingly rare in several parts of the range, though can outnumber other eagles (apart from the slightly more adaptable black hawk-eagle). This species dwells in well forested regions, preferring tall, wet or humid, tropical and subtropical forests. Although some of the species can dwell in dry tropical forest this is usually quite secondary habitat. More so than black hawk-eagles, the ornate hawk-eagle tends to be found primarily only in unbroken primary forest tracts. Some records indicate that the ornate hawk-eagle may persist on tracts of forest down to only but usually such extensive deforestation causes the species to vacate the area.

In some areas, the hawk-eagles may occasional habituate partially to edges, riversides and other openings, also into gallery strips and relatively short swamp forest. Deciduous forests, mixed pine-oak, taller stretches of secondary forests and shade coffee plantations, as long they have tall native tree canopies, may be visited and even locally nested in, as was recorded in Mexico. In Guatemala, they are often fairly distant from openings and dwell almost entirely in primary forest, especially areas where at least one very tall tree emerged above the average canopy level and there is less forest understory to more easily execute hunting. The Guatemalan hawk-eagles preferred fairly homogenous forest in drier upland parts of the humid forest, since the hilly areas of the forest tended to have more of the aforementioned habitat characteristic. However, the hawk-eagles here did sometimes occur in scrub-swamp forests as long as it retained tall trees, however the ornate hawk-eagles who nested in scrub-swamp forest type often went to the upland areas to hunt. Dietary habits The ornate hawk-eagle is a powerful predator that readily varies its prey selection among two main prey groups. Largely the most significant prey for the species are medium to large sized birds. The other main prey type are a variety of small to medium-sized mammals. On occasion, reptiles may form a seldom part of the diet. This species largely forages inside forests, often perch-hunting. This entails short flights from tree to tree at mid-story heights while foraging or still-hunting from inconspicuous vantage points near the center of a dense canopy. Upon prey detection, they swoop to grasp the prey on the ground or in trees or engage in tail chases among trees. The agility imparted by its relative small and broad wings and longish tail and talent for tail-chases in enclosed woods and thickets are why this and similar eagles are referred to as “hawk-eagles”, in reference to similar hunting styles in the “true hawks” (i.e., the members of the Accipiter genus). In size, tail length and hunting style, the ornate hawk-eagle in particular is quite similar to the largest races of the largest Accipiter species, the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). Most witnessed tail-chases by this species have involved chasing various gamebirds, with about equal accounts of successful and unsuccessful pursuits. In Guatemala, most attacks were launched when the hawk-eagle was from its quarry, with all successful attacks on prey on ground or low bushes and were from perches at high or lower in the trees. In Manú National Park, Peru, most observed attacks were untaken within about of the prey and prey was attacked mostly on the ground, although they also captured rails from shallow water (in one case losing a gallinule rail to a nearby caiman before the hawk-eagle could carry its prey away).

The hawk-eagles made bold, fast dives into the middle of the leks, quickly grabbing a male cock-of-the-rock. Subsequently, one hawk-eagle consumed the bird right on the spot in one case and the other took its catch to a nearby perch. Reported instances of \"power dives\" into troops of monkeys and even heronries are probably similar in nature to the cock-of-the-rock attacks. In one case, an ornate hawk-eagle was able to capture a black vulture (Coragyps atratus) that had come to the carcass of a monkey that the hawk-eagle itself may have also killed. In general, a picture has emerged that the ornate hawk-eagle is a particularly opportunistic predator, attracted to conspicuous prey behaviors and less deeply searching in its foraging than most co-existing forest eagles. In total, well over 100 prey species are known for ornate hawk-eagles. Of particularly broad import to ornate hawk-eagles are the cracid family of gamebirds such as chachalacas, guans and curassows. In fact, local names refer to this species at times as the \"guan hawk\" or the \"curassow hawk”. At least twelve species of cracid are taken quite often where available (including the crested guan [Penelope purpurascens]), and this is probably only a partial list of the species they hunt. However, the ornate hawk-eagle is far from specialized on cracid prey and takes more or less any medium-sized or larger avian prey they opportune upon. In total, about 65% of recorded prey species for ornate hawk-eagles are birds. Beyond cracids, some of the most significant prey families and orders are tinamou (at least 8 species), pigeons and doves (9 species or more), toucans (at least 7 species), parrots (at least 9 species) as well as assorted non-cracid gamebirds (such as New World quails) and largish passerines. In Tikal, Guatemala, the most often identified avian prey on 10 ornate hawk-eagle territories was the keel-billed toucan (Ramphastos sulfuratus), accounting for 11.3% of 408 prey items, followed by the plain chachalaca (Ortalis vetula) (6.5%) and great tinamou (Tinamus major) (4%) (in by far the largest dietary study conducted for this hawk-eagle). In total, birds were 56.3% of the foods for the species at the Tikal study. Another Guatemalan study observed 6 avian prey items and 1 mammal (bat) as prey as a hawk-eagle nest. The next largest known study, in rainforests near Manaus, Brazil, found among 82 prey items, birds made up 63.3% of the diet. The most often identified avian prey here were probable dusky-legged guan (Penelope obscura) (20.4%) and two species of large tinamous (12.24%). At a slightly smaller dietary study of the southern part of the Atlantic forest of Brazil found that 90% of 30 prey items were birds, principally brown tinamou (Crypturellus obsoletus) (33.3%), Leptotila doves (10%), dusky-legged guan and green-barred woodpecker (Colaptes melanochloros) (both 6.67%).

More secondary avian prey recorded for ornate hawk-eagles includes cuckoos, potoos, rails, trumpeters, herons and egrets, vultures, owls, kingfishers, motmots and hoatzins (Opisthocomus hoazin). However, at both Tikal and Manaus, the most often identified prey species types were mammals. In Tikal, the similar Yucatan squirrel (Sciurus yucatanensis) and the Deppe's squirrel (Sciurus deppei) lead the food by number, accounting for 28.2% of the foods. In Manu, unidentified species of large terrestrial rodents, either agoutis or the similar but smaller acouchis took the primary position, making up 24.4% of the diet. At a single nest in Henri Pittier National Park, Venezuela, without presented metrics, rodents and mammals were observed to outnumber birds in the diet, namely the red-tailed squirrel (Sciurus granatensis) and cotton rats (Sigmodon ssp.). Among mammals, these medium to fairly large rodents regardless of whether they show terrestrial (agoutis and similar species) or arboreal (tree squirrels) tendencies make up the largest known portion of the food, perhaps most key being partially diurnal habits. Another widely recorded mammalian prey group are procyonids despite a slight penchant for more nocturnal activity, including such prey as raccoon (Procyon lotor), white-nosed coati (Nasua narica), kinkajou (Poto flavus) and cacomistle (Bassariscus sumichrasti). Usually the hawk-eagles are likely to target juveniles of the larger species of procyonid, although adults at least up to the size of kinkajous may be taken. However, certainly the most well-studied mammalian prey for ornate hawk-eagles are New World monkeys, which they do not hunt necessarily seem to hunt preferentially. However, they are unlikely to ignore an opportunity to prey upon primates. Among monkeys, mainly those of a smaller size class are hunted, largely such groups as squirrel monkeys, tamarins, marmosets and titi monkeys are attacked. In most such monkey species, adults usually weigh less than , and juveniles may be slightly more regularly taken even for species this small. Larger primates, those averaging over , are on occasion vulnerable to predation by ornate hawk-eagles including white-faced sakis (Pithecia pithecia), Guatemalan black howler (Alouatta pigra) (certainly only juveniles of this very large howler monkey) and some species of capuchin monkey. Due to the range of predators that they attract given their relatively smaller size, monkeys in the neotropics are highly wary and have well-developed anti-predator defenses, especially a variety of alarm calls, grouping techniques, great arboreal agility and aggressive defensive attacks by top males, all of which make monkeys more difficult to attack than more solitary, terrestrial and/or slower-moving mammal prey of similar size. Relatively few mammalian prey are taken outside of rodents, procyonids and monkeys, but ornate hawk-eagles are also known to take Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis), other leaf-nosed bats, a few species of opossum, silky anteaters (Cyclopes didactylus) and even apparently bush dogs (Speothos venaticus). One reported instance of scavenging on carrion has been reported for this hawk-eagle, on the carcass of a domestic cow (Bos primigenius taurus).

In one estimate, most prey (specifically avian types) was estimated to weigh between . In the large study of Tikal, Guatemala, the size of prey items was estimated to weigh from for the Jamaican fruit bat to for the great curassow (Crax rubra). Another prey item taken of similar size to the fruit bat is the Mexican mouse opossum (Marmosa mexicana) and these two species are the smallest known mammalian prey for ornate hawk-eagle. The smallest avian prey recorded thus far is the long-tailed silky-flycatcher (Ptilogonys caudatus). Otherwise, passerine prey taken are slightly larger, usually various jays and icterids, resulting in persistent mobbing of hawk-eagles by species such as brown jays (Psilorhinus morio) (this loud mobbing of the hawk-eagles in Central America in turn allows researchers to more easily find the raptors). Despite the ornate hawk-eagles' notable predatory power and ability to take large prey, mean prey sizes taken in a couple of estimates are not exceptional relative to their own body mass, though are perhaps slightly higher than those for most similarly sized raptors. In the Tikal study, mean prey size was estimated at , with avian prey averaging an estimated and mammal prey (which consisted largely of squirrels) averaging an estimated . In the smaller dietary study from the Atlantic forests of Brazil, estimated mean prey size was . Thus mean prey sizes from the two studies averages at about 34-42% of the hawk-eagle's own body size. Within their enclosed forest habitats, ornate hawk-eagle are capable of attacking much of the largest avian prey available, excepting larger birds of prey (the largest regional water birds such as storks rarely enter deep forest habitat). This species is capable of tackling healthy prey weighing up to at least four times its own weight. These include the aforementioned great curassow and the ocellated turkey (Meleagris ocellata), of which the ornate hawk-eagle is capable of taking adults weighing or more. Mammalian prey taken can reach an estimated in the case of a Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata). Other mammalian prey including the largest procyonids and monkeys hunted by the hawk-eagle can reach similar body masses, i.e., approximately and perhaps even up to around . Of a similar size range to these largest birds and mammals, numerous successful attacks have reported on adults of the green iguana (Iguana iguana), which weigh an average of about . When capturing such large prey, ornate hawk-eagles are incapable of flying with them. In the case of agoutis and curassows killed in Tikal, the hawk-eagles would return repeatedly to feed on their kill, ultimately consuming about half of the bodies before decomposition sets in. A male ornate hawk-eagle that had killed a great tinamou of roughly equal weight to itself (both around ) was similarly grounded after being unable to fly with its kill (only consuming the head before being flushed by researchers).

Furthermore, there appears to be considerable habitat selection overlap between these species, including both black-and-white hawk-eagle and black hawk-eagle, although the latter is somewhat more adaptable to openings and forest fragmentation. Furthermore, the larger species such as the crested and harpy eagle are largely concurrent in distribution and habitat with the ornate hawk-eagle. While interspecies relations of neotropical eagles are relatively poorly known, it is likely that there is some degree of natural partitioning to allow the raptors to co-exist. To the best knowledge of ornithologists and other researchers, the most likely form of partitioning comes in the form of the dietary preferences. While the three lowland hawk-eagles select broadly similar prey species across their prey spectrum, each focuses primarily on a different prey group. While the largest dietary study from Tikal, Guatemala showed that ornate hawk-eagle somewhat prefers relatively larger class birds, such as cracids. tinamous and toucans, alternately with smallish, primarily diurnal mammals, adjacent studies in Tikal of the black hawk-eagles shows they primarily hunted small, nocturnal mammals such as bats and mouse opossums. Other (but not all) studies also indicate a preference for mammals of varying sizes (perhaps to the size of raccoons) in the diet of black hawk-eagles. Meanwhile, black-and-white hawk-eagles have been indicated to show a preference for slightly smaller birds than those selected by ornate hawk-eagles, such as medium-to-large passerines, pigeons and smallish toucans (such as aracaris and toucanets), though capable of preying on adult ducks and even monkeys quite as large as those taken by the ornate. The most similar hawk-eagle by diet is the closely related black-and-chestnut eagle, as this often hunts gamebirds such as cracids and procyonids like the ornate, but this species has a different altitudinal range being found in forests in the high montane forests, usually at a minimum elevation of . Other eagle-like forest raptors such as solitary eagles (Buteogallus solitarius), whose mountainous range (similar to the black-and-chestnut) barely abuts the altitudinal range with ornate hawk-eagle, have strongly different dietary preferences (e.g., snakes) while other Buteogallus species tend to be much more aquatically based both in diet and habitat preferences. Overlap in the prey spectrum is known with both crested and harpy eagles, but dietary preferences differ considerably. In the harpy eagle, preferred prey are sloths (which have never been known to fall prey to ornate hawk-eagles) and larger sized New World monkeys. Meanwhile, the crested eagle seems to prefer intermediately sized mammals, including monkeys mostly between tamarin and capuchin monkey-sized, but to also seemingly take prey of more varied classes than other lowland forest eagles. In Tikal, like the black hawk-eagle, the crested eagle appears to prefer nocturnal mammals, mostly various opossums, and presumably has a more intensive searching method of hunting rather than the opportunistic hunting typical of the ornate species. In terms of predation on monkeys, a guild of avian predators and a corresponding forest wild cat appear rather neatly partitioned by the size of monkeys being hunted: Spizaetus eagles as well as other relatively small but powerful",

The various forest eagles of the neotropics appear to be surprisingly tolerant of other species, with almost no aggressive interspecies interactions known in the literature. Mostly only vultures seem to provoke a slight aggressive reaction from the parents in nesting ornate hawk-eagles (possibly because some studies indicate that forest-foraging vultures are more commonly egg thieves than those found in more open habitats). Although, in one Guatemalan study the presence of flying black hawk-eagles and swallow-tailed kites (Elanoides forficatus) (which are unlikely to prey on nests) also provoked a defensive whistle by the brooding female ornate hawk-eagle. Indicating a lack of interspecies aggression, one active harpy eagle nest was set with a camera trap captured photographs of a pair of ornate hawk-eagles in a breeding display in the immediate vicinity of the nest, with both species apparently indifferent to each other's presence. Breeding Ornate hawk-eagles, like most but not all raptors, live solitarily or in pairs. Breeding territories are maintained through high circling, either by a solo adult or by a pair. Most displays occur in mid to late morning and are usually at fairly low heights with occasional calling. Sometimes one bird breaks into butterfly-like flight with shallow flutters during display. Other noisy acrobatics are engaged by the male while the female perches, some of which are correlated with courtship. In a mutual display, the pair gliding in tight circles, the male approaching the female from above and behind, as the female rolls to her back and they engage in talon grabbing, occasionally touching. The aerial display of the ornate hawk-eagle can escalate into roller coaster sky-dance involving series of dives at about 45 degrees on half-closed wings interspersed with heavy looking climbs and floppy beats with looping gyrations and occasionally a complete loop. Home range size is variable in different seasons, from and estimated density can vary from one 1 bird per to 13 birds per in parts of Guatemala and French Guiana, respectively.

In the Petén area of Guatemala there is an estimated nesting density of one pair per .

The dichotomy in breeding habits is often most extreme in forest-dwelling tropical raptor species, which in large species tend to have an extremely prolonged post-fledging care stage for young raptors. The breeding season of ornate hawk-eagles normally falls between December and September in Central America, while it is largely in August–January in Brazil. Courtship and nesting behavior were seen in Panama during August to October (later in the year than nearby black hawk-eagles, implying a temporal difference in nesting times for the two species). In Trinidad and Tobago, nest building is around November while in Venezuela was reportedly in March. This species seemingly lays its clutches in the dry season and fledges in the early wet season. In Tikal, Guatemala, the mean egg laying time was mid-March, while in Belize it was similar but slightly earlier in March. In the extensive studies from Tikal, eggs were laid variously anytime from November to May, but 83% were between January and April. Meanwhile, in the Manaus area of Brazil egg laying peaks in August, although copulation has been witnessed as long before than as in June, which may imply a particularly prolonged courtship stage. Copulation typically lasts for 6–12 seconds with 60 copulations recorded in 204 hours of observation. Nests This species builds a bulky, large stick nest that is generally typical of an accipitrid. Nests are exclusively located in trees. The nest height is often above the ground. Two nests in Guatemala were about both in trees of a total height of around while, in Belize, the nest height of 3 were from in trees of a total height of . In Tikal, 14 nests were found to be at anywhere from above the ground with an average of and an average total nesting tree height of . Nest heights in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil were between . Tree species are often variable, the most significant factor in the seeming selection of nesting trees is that it is often the tallest tree in the forest stand, emerging above the average canopy height. In Tikal, six nests were in Honduran mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), four were in kapok or ceiba trees (Ceiba pentandra), two in invasive black olive (Olea europaea) and single nests in various genera such as Ficus, Piscidia, Cedrela, Pouteria and Calophyllum. Further studies show that ceiba trees are popular elsewhere in the northern part of the range. Nests are placed in relatively exposed branches, often being on the main crutch of the tree or the largest, most bare branch (in comparison, black hawk-eagle nests are more difficult to find since they are typically inside the denser foliage of the canopy). Typical sized nests are about across and about deep. 16 nests in Tikal averaged in diameter and in outer depth. In the Manaus area of Brazil, a single nest was a relatively large in diameter.

Single egg clutches are also laid by other Spizaetus hawk-eagles. However, in captivity, at least one female has been known to lay a two egg clutch. The eggs are mainly white in color sparingly overlaid with brownish or brown-red splotches. In texture, the eggs are not glossy and are somewhat pitted to the touch. In Tikal, the eggs averaged (in a sample of four) and weighed typically about . The two egg clutch recorded in captivity differed in many respects from those of wild Guatemalan hawk-eagles. They were smaller, the first measuring and weighing , the second measuring and weighing . Additionally, instead of being whitish with faint brown or reddish spotting, they were unspotted and bluish-white in color. Parental behavior Prior to egg-laying, the female may remain in the area of the nest 97.2% of the time while the male was in the vicinity only 30.4% of the time in Tikal. Both prior to egg laying and during incubation, the female of the pair often collects green leaves to line the nest bowl, doing so nearly every day both in Guatemala and the Manaus area of Brazil. The female takes a lion's share of the incubation duties. For example, records from Guatemala and Belize show she incubates about 95-97% of observed hours. In 127 hours in Guatemala, she left her egg unattended only for a period of 9 minutes. Incubation lasted for 43 to 48 days in Tikal while in Belize incubation was for 44 to 46 days. As in most accipitrids, males usually capture prey and bring it to the female throughout incubation. When delivering prey, the male and female may call back and forth for several minutes before exchanging the prey item. Furthermore, in Guatemala, the male would relieve the female for any amount of time from 9 minutes to 68 minutes while the female fed, in Brazil he never approached the nest but in one case attempted to and was aggressively displaced by his larger mate. Prey deliveries are done foot-to-foot, and in Tikal the females would immediately behead each mammal or remove the beak from each bird prey item brought to her. During both incubation and subsequent to hatching, both parents may defend their offspring from potential predators, but especially the female. Vultures seem to provoke an aggressive response in different parts of the range, consisting of the female raising her crest, mantling over her egg and calling loudly. Egg-eating mammals seem to provoke a more active anti-predator defense. In Brazil, red-faced spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus) were seen to be attacked and swooped upon by the female, but in a second encounter during which the monkey troop returned, she remained on the nest. Similar anti-predator behavior was observed in Guatemala, where Geoffroy's spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) were flown at and struck until they left the vicinity.

Studies from Guatemala show that humans also draw the ire of the female ornate hawk-eagle. It was found that while climbing to a tree blind near the nest tree that females regularly struck researchers, often causing lacerations even with protective gear on, and were rated as considerably more aggressive in nest defense than black hawk-eagles and crested eagles. In Oaxaca, Mexico, a researcher was struck instead by the male of an ornate hawk-eagle pair. In the Manaus, perhaps because of a larger regional human population causing more shyness or desensitization to human activities, female ornate hawk-eagles were less aggressive to humans in the nest vicinity and did not respond even to workers using chainsaws within of the nest. Nesting development The hatching date in this species is, of course, dependent on when the eggs are laid. Studies from the Tikal area showed 90% of hatching occurred between February and June, peaking between late April and early May. It is likely that the hatching period here is timed with the peak time for fledging of other bird species for easy prey capture. Hatching was observed at a single nest in Trinidad and Tobago in March. In Manaus, Brazil, hatching occurred in September. In Venezuela, the hatchling eagle was found to measure in length and weigh . The studies from Tikal and Manaus describe details of the nestling development over time. Like most birds, and especially birds of prey, the hatchlings are initially altricial. In this species, the eaglets are still unable to lift their heads at 2–4 days old. By about two weeks of age, the young eaglet can start to stand on its folded leg within the nest. The begging calls will increase at about 3 weeks of age. A case in Guatemala of a 16-day-old nestling trying to feed itself and defecate over the nest edge is considered rather early for both behaviors. At 36 days, the young hawk-eagle may begin to peck at carcasses but at 49 days cannot still effectively fed itself, with the first food tearing and eating recorded at between 52 and 54 days of age. At 39 days, the feathers of the wing and the tail begin to overtake the down. By the 8th week, the eaglet should be able to stand, wing flap and play with sticks within the nest. A week later, the young tend to be markedly more independent, largely feeding themselves on the carcasses their parents provide and ranging out of the nest for the first time on branches up to from their nest, often flapping their wings a considerable amount. Fledging may occur at any age from 60 to 93 days. The average age at fledgling was estimated as 77.5 days in Tikal while in Belize it was similarly in the range of 70 to 84 days.

The young eagles often continue to beg loudly for food, especially once their parents are in view, but if their crop is full they often retire to quietly sit in dense foliage. In one case from Brazil, the juvenile eagle was observed to fly up to greet one of its parents and grabbed the prey item without landing before continuing to a nearby perch. In Guatemala, three young males were still in away from the nest at 5 months of age. In the same area, two females of 9 months age were typically away from the nest while another two young females of the same age were at an average distance from the nest of . At 11–12 months, the juveniles may begin to soar around their parents' territory. 3 females in Tikal gradually increase their wanderings at 12–14 months old, ranging anywhere from to from the nest. Around a year of age, the juvenile eagles are likely to make their first attempts to hunt prey. The minimum age at which independence appears to be possible for ornate hawk-eagles is around 11.5–12 months. The average age of independence in studies from Tikal was found to 15.4 months of age for 13 banded juveniles. More poorly known is the age of maturity, which has been estimated at only two years, a matter of months after independence and when the hawk-eagles appear to enter their subadult plumage stage. There is little inconvertible evidence that the species begins breeding at any younger than three years of age. At least one case in Tikal was observed of a pair both in subadult plumage that was breeding, however. While breeding success rates are not known for this species this same subadult breeding pair was observed to kill and cannibalize a juvenile from another territory. When a nest was in imminent risk of flooding from the overflow of a nearby reservoir in southern Brazil, a pair of ornate hawk-eagles appeared to accept translocation when researchers relocated an entire nest intact with nestling in tow to nearby tree, at away. In interspecies comparisons, Tikal studies showed that black hawk-eagles are independent slightly faster at around 12 months old but, like the ornate, also reach maturity roughly in the zone of 2 to 3 years of age while crested eagles take 22.7–30 months until independence and start breeding somewhere around 3 to 4 years of age. In many of the larger eagles, including the harpy eagle, whether tropical or temperate zone dwelling, the minimum age of maturity seems to be around 5 years of age and in some large Afro-tropical species, possibly ranges up to more than 7 years of age. Status The ornate hawk-eagle is, like many large birds of prey, probably naturally scarce. However, the species has shown a marked declining trend.

Various means of analysis in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil all showed it to be least densely populated of the three species of Spizaetus in the area. In particular, when compared to the black hawk-eagle, the ornate hawk-eagle is much less tolerant of partial deforestation and human disturbance and is generally rather more scarce. For example, in the fragmented forest of Paranapiacaba, Brazil, the black hawk-eagle was recorded 2.5 times more frequently during surveys than the ornate species. The species is locally extinct in several former parts of the range. It is thought to have gone extinct early due to increased extensive 19th century colonization in Tumbes, Peru as well as the Belém and probably the São Francisco regions of Brazil. More recently, the continued presence of breeding ornate hawk-eagles was considered doubtful or at critical threat level in western Ecuador and local biologists considered the species to be extirpated from Colima, Mexico. Evidence indicates declines are likely occurring in almost every part of the species' distribution. Biologists working in Southeastern Brazil felt that the species, though still present, should be uplisted to regionally critically endangered. Increases or apparent breeding records of the species in new areas are likely not correlated to actual population increases but are more likely cases of the species being driven from adjacent areas as habitats become unacceptable, accounting for increased records of the species at drier forests (i.e., in Mexico) or in higher elevations (i.e., in Colombia). What were considered possible range expansions in different areas of Brazil, such as the Caatinga (Serra das Confusões National Park) and Rio Grande do Sul, as well as in northwestern Peru, may be more likely mere cases of more extensive bird surveying in previously little studied areas. The ornate hawk eagle has a status of rare but persisting on Panamanian islands, Coiba and Barro Colorado Island. The leading cause, by far, for the species decline is epidemic levels of deforestation. The terribly extensive deforestation of several areas of the neotropics, particularly the Amazon rainforest, was the catalyst for the species being uplisted in 2012. Declines are correlated to deforestation in most parts of the species' range, all the way from the northern limits in Mexico down to the southern limits in Argentina. Even where lands become protected, it is in many cases too late due to forest fragmentation prior to conservation, resulting in stands too fragmented to support extensive use by the ornate hawk-eagles. Canopy coverage of the forest must be at least 80% in order to retain this hawk-eagle, per a study of its habitat ranging in Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. Beyond deforestation, human hunting is also causing declines of this species. In part this is due to competition for resources. For example, studies in Tikal, Guatemala showed that 49.4% of the biomass at ornate hawk-eagle nests was overlapping with the wild animals most extensively hunted by local humans (i.e., cracids, agoutis, squirrels).

It was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 film of the same name, sustainability, the site's history as a shipyard, and immigration. They were removed on November 23, 2017 for repairs, but later restored to their original location. Background The Birds was the first work of public art to be approved under the city's Olympic and Paralympic Public Art Program. It was installed in Southeast False Creek Olympic Plaza, which served as the site of the 2010 Olympic Village, in April 2010. MacLeod was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 film of the same name. She has said of the piece, \"I think it boils down to wanting to make something sublime for the plaza – that is something beautiful, but frightening at the same time.\" She has also said of its inspiration: The Birds was also inspired by sustainability and the site's history as a shipyard, where sailors often wore sparrow tattoos. The sculptures have been called an \"ode to immigration\" based on MacLeod's interest in \"alien species\" and when non-native species are introduced to an environment (the house sparrow is not native to North America). MacLeod said: \"My work for the Olympic Village tries to infuse the ordinary and commonplace sparrow with a touch of the ridiculous and the sublime. Locating this artwork in an urban plaza not only highlights what has become the 'natural' environment of the sparrow, it also reinforces the 'small' problem of introducing a foreign species and the subsequent havoc wreaked upon our ecosystems.\" The sculptures were produced by Heavy Industries, with some bodywork completed by Semi-Rigid Plastic Parts Repair. The Birds was the last of the public art program's works to be installed, despite being the first approved. Description The work depicts one male and one female house sparrow, each between tall, or approximately life size. The birds have been described as realistic and \"massive yet friendly-looking\". Their bodies are made from hard coated expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam, coated with a polyurea skin and airbrush painted, all clad around a steel armature. Their cast bronze legs were sealed with wax. According to Heavy, the EPS form pieces were \"glued together with pressure-sensitive adhesive, specifically formulated for bonding EPS to itself and other materials\". Reception Marsha Lederman of The Globe and Mail called the sculptures \"huge and intimidating and a bit creepy\", but acknowledged the artist's intent. Explaining connection between immigration and sparrows specifically, she wrote that the birds were introduced \"to satisfy cultural nostalgia for homesick Europeans. The birds were alien, exotic. They're now ubiquitous. Part of the everyday landscape. Barely noticed… Not these\" Tuija Seipell of Jaunted said the sparrows were reminiscent of the bird that Flick and the Blueberries build to scare the Hoppers in the 1998 film A Bug's Life.

They are created because of a pedagogical choice of a school or school district. They are different from split classes which are formed when there are too many students for one class – but not enough to form two classes of the same grade level. Composite classes are more common in smaller schools; an extreme form is the one-room school. Studies of the performance of students in composite classes shows their academic performance is not substantially different from those in single-grade classrooms; instead, outcomes tend to be a function of the teacher's performance. History and prevalence Multi-age schooling originated in one-room schoolhouses during the 19th century. It became less common in the 20th century with the rise of mainstream schooling. However, multi-age schooling had a resurgence in the 1960s. Approximately one third of all classes across the world are multigrade classes. “In Canada, more than 20 percent of students are registered in split classes, and that number is growing. Around the world, split classes are also a growing phenomenon in countries as diverse as Australia, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands.” (Kelly, 2015) The reasoning behind multi-age classrooms is distinct from that of split classes. While split classes are created when there are not enough students to form two separate single age classes, multi-age classes are intentionally formed to create a mixed age, diverse learning environment. This is an important distinction, as the reason for creating a split class or multi-age class will dictate what kinds of teaching strategies and pedagogy is applied in the classroom, which will in turn impact student outcomes. For a given number of students, composite classes allow greater administrative flexibility in allocating students to classes. This allows gender balancing, matching of student needs to teaching expertise, and balancing class sizes. By allocating children to classes according to specific learning needs, it is possible to arrange classes with narrower ranges of abilities. Schools composed exclusively of composite classes are increasingly common in Australian primary school education; they are not uncommon in New Zealand. Composite classes often meet resistance, with parents often believing that their child is disadvantaged by being in one. This perception is often regardless of whether their child would be in the younger or older cohort. Advocates of multi-age classrooms point to the lack of age stratification in workplaces, families or other social environments as a reason to create a similar environment in the classroom. Cited benefits Social benefits often cited are: Older children in a composite class get more leadership opportunities and frequently build self-esteem as a sort or role model to the younger class mates. Younger children aspire to do work like the older children in the class. The ability for a child to be educated by the one teacher for two years, creating a stronger relationship.

        "prompt": "ability groups, teachers need heightened awareness of individual student's capabilities – they must think of children as individuals. The techniques of classroom teaching and of individual teaching can be still applied. Learning by teaching occurs when students at different stages of learning can help each other with their work; children resolve differences in understanding of material. Composite classes provide a range of levels of work, so the needs of both talented children and slower learners can be catered for, while providing a supportive environment for both. At any one time, both composite and single-level classes have groups of students at a variety of levels. This is part of the normal delivery of the curriculum. Education expectations are set at curriculum levels which span across two years; for example, see the Victorian Essential Learning Standards. Contemporary teaching and learning materials are developed for multi-age classes. By using them, teachers can introduce core concepts to the whole classroom, and then differentiate instruction for the range of learners in the classroom. Other considerations The students will be of a greater range of size, age and maturity which can have both positive and negative implications particularly in class sporting activities and playground interaction. Opposition to multi-age classrooms and criticism Opponents of multi-age classrooms argue that most parents would rather have their children in a single grade-level classroom instead of a multi-grade level classroom. They also argue that students in the upper grade level of a composite class learn the same material that they were taught in the lower grade level. In contrast, talented children may find the work too easy since they have already learned it. However, slower learners, or students who failed the curriculum or a certain subject may have been placed in a composite class to catch up to the curriculum or become more proficient in a subject.

References Education issues Educational years School terminologyMarcantonio Flaminio (winter 1497/98 – February 1550), also known as Marcus Antonius Flaminius, was an Italian humanist poet, known for his Neo-Latin works. During his life, he toured the courts and literary centers of Italy. His editing of the popular devotional work, the \"Beneficio di Cristo\" illustrated a hope that the Catholic Church would move closer to some of the thinking of the Protestant reformers. Biography Flaminio grew up in Serravalle, a small village in the Veneto (in the north of Italy). When he was 11, Austria invaded the Veneto, and Marcantonio and his family were forced to flee to his father's native village, Imola, a village south of Bologna. A friendly cardinal gave the family financial support. In 1514, Flaminio was given the chance to go to Rome to get a broader education. By that time the boy was already \"an accomplished scholar, and something of a poet\". He was introduced to Pope Leo X, and placed by",

Falconi has suggested that Leo became infatuated with the seventeen-year-old; arranging the best education that could be offered for the time. However, suspicions of Leo's less than honest motives seem to have led to Flaminio's father intervening, and taking the unusual step of declining a certain career in the church as mapped by Leo, in favour of demanding his son return to university at Bologna. That same year, Flaminio also went to Naples, where he met Jacopo Sannazaro. They became close friends, and the latter greatly influenced Flaminio's poetry. In 1515, Flaminio moved to Bologna, where he dedicated himself to the study of philosophy. His first poems were published that year in a collection consisting of odes, eclogues, epitaphs and Catullan love lyrics. All the poems follow the tradition of Neo-Latin secular verse, taking up the subjects of the famous classical poets (such as Virgil, Ovid, and Catullus). In university, he met new lifelong friends, but after a few years, Bologna begins to bore him. In 1520, now an adult, he travelled to Padua, to study literature, Aristotelian philosophy, and law, but fell seriously ill with syphilis. He survived, and in the same year, accompanied by his patron Domenico Sauli, he visited Rome to witness the coronation of the new Pope, Clement VII. Rome, by that time, was a place where the plague had free rein, the river Tiber overflowed its banks, and a war was in progress. Maddison says: \"…the cardinals had fled, paganism had come into life — an ox was crowned with flowers and sacrificed in the Colosseum…\". In 1524, he met Bishop Giberti of Verona and was taken into his household in 1528, in which he continued to live for the next 14 years. The group of bishops, poets, and scientists within the household were keen to put into practice the ideas of a \"reformed church\". That year, Flaminio became a member of the Oratorio del Divino Amore, \"a group of 60 clerics and laymen who met on Sunday afternoons in the church of Saints Silvestro and Dorotea in Trastevere to discuss theology and to practise spiritual exercises\". From this period on, he became more serious and philosophical. According to Nichols, \"He became more and more intensely concerned with religion, devoting himself in particular to the study of the psalms…\". He studied Greek, Hebrew and theology and began to read the works of religious reformers. In 1536, his father died, and Flaminio returned home. When he came back to Rome, he gained the favour of the rich and influential Farnese family, which provided some protection despite his strong and controversial interest in church reform. In 1538, his health worsened, and he decided to live in Naples. After a year, he visited the Count of Caserta where he remained for over a year. He regained his health and wrote his second book of Lusus Pastorales.

In 1541 he moved to Viterbo to form part of Cardinal Reginald Pole's household. Pole was likewise one of the leading figures pushing for reform, and dialogue with the protestant theologians. In Venice in 1543, the Beneficio di Cristo, \"the most popular devotional work in sixteenth-century Italy\" was published. The work was heavily influenced by John Calvin's \"Institutes\" of 1539, and incorporated substantial quotes. It has been described as a \"deeply Augustinian work\", and stressed throughout man's absolute dependence on Christ for salvation. The first four chapters, in particular, expounded the doctrine of salvation by faith alone (Sola fide). Without faith in God, man is incapable of good works. The book was subsequently condemned by the Inquisition, and Flaminio was thought to have been behind its editing and publication. In 1545 the Council of Trent was reconvened. Flaminio was offered a secretaryship by the Pope but was forced to decline it (he did so in an elegy to Alessandro Farnese) because of ill health. During this period he did find time to write a poetic paraphrase of several Biblical psalms. In the spring of 1548, he fell seriously ill, suffering from malaria, and died in 1550 in Rome. During his life, Flaminio was always a purist poet: in his Latin poetry, he referred only to the best classical writers; he specialised in pastoral poems, which were about pure love and nature. This idea also fits with his religious views, which stressed purity and the importance of a personal relationship with God, de-emphasizing the intermediary role of the Church. Works In 1515, Flaminio's first collection of poems was published, containing poems in many different genres. Before his twenties, he also published an edition of a posthumous work of Marullus. In 1526, he finished his first book (which he started in 1521) of Lusus Pastorales, a collection of bucolic epigrams). He also wrote an elegy about his syphilis and several other elegies, as well as odes, epigrams, hymns, eclogues and epitaphs (and a large number of letters in various poetic forms to his friends, colleagues and patrons). He paraphrased 32 psalms in prose, and 30 in poetry. He also translated several works from several languages to Latin and Italian. All his Latin poetry has been brought together in a modern collection Carmina, consisting of eight books. In the last two years of his life he wrote poetic memorials to his friends (about 127 people). After his death, Flaminio's Carmina Sacra was found and published in 1551. The poems were written in the last few years of his life and are \"simple and eloquent religious poems\" References Sources The facsimile of the 1543 Venice edition of the Benefit of Christ (il Beneficio di Cristo) can be viewed beginning on p. 104 of The Benefit of Christ's Death, London/Cambridge, 1855 1490s births 1550 deaths People from the Province of Treviso Italian poets Italian male poets Italian Renaissance humanists Deaths from malaria 16th-century Italian translatorsThe Reciprocal Public",

Saran retired in April 2012. Post retirement After her retirement, she spends her time by engaging in social activities. She gave more importance to road safety sector by taking awareness sessions in schools, colleges and has been engaging and creating awareness through NGOs too. She also inaugurated a massive Traffic Awareness Campaign held on 100 traffic signals across Chennai on same day and same time on 9 August 2015 organized by Thozhan NGO which works on creating road safety awareness along with Good Samaritan Law awareness to transform our country as Accident Free Nation Along with the volunteers, she also interacted with the public, distributed awareness pamphlets and spoke to them about the importance of following road safety rules.

Oligoryzomys nigripes is a species that has been further divided into different sister taxa throughout history. It is found in different countries in South America. It is a large species with long ears, dark yellow to dark brown upperparts, sharply delimited from the whitish underparts, and often a pink girdle on the chest. This species of rat spends much of its life among the trees. The karyotype is 2n = 62, FNa = 78–82. Synonym species Two other species, Oligoryzomys delticola (also known as the delta pygmy rice rat or the large colilargo) and Oligoryzomys eliurus (also known as the Brazilian pygmy rice rat or the Brazilian colilargo) have been recognized as synonyms of O. nigripes since 2005; they cannot be distinguished on the basis of morphology, karyotype, or morphometrics. Location Oligoryzomys nigripes is found from Pernambuco in northeastern Brazil through the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado into Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina, where it occurs in the provinces of Chaco, Misiones, and Buenos Aires. Morphology The pelage colors for this species resemble brown, dark yellow, and grey. This species of Oligoryzomys have small bodies and long tails.",

Rather than being crushed in a wine press or by another mechanized method, grapes are repeatedly trampled in vats by barefoot participants to release their juices and begin fermentation. Grape-treading was widespread in the history of winemaking, but with the introduction of industrial methods, it now survives mostly as a recreational or competitive activity at cultural festivals. History One of the earliest extant visual representations of the practice appears on a Roman Empire sarcophagus from the 3rd century AD, which depicts an idealized pastoral scene with a group of Erotes harvesting and stomping grapes at Vindemia, a rural festival. Many contemporary wineries hold grape-stomping contests to attract visitors. The practice is also the subject of many depictions in contemporary media, including the 1974 Mel Tillis song \"Stomp Them Grapes\", the I Love Lucy episode \"Lucy's Italian Movie\", and The Littlest Grape Stomper, a children's book by Alan Madison. The novel The Secret of Santa Vittoria and the film based on it, taking place in a wine-producing Italian town during WWII, include a grape treading scene which has a major role in the battle of wits between the townspeople and their German occupiers. Special Experience Harvest experience tours, also known as \"harvest internships\" or \"crush camps,\" are tours or programs that allow visitors to experience the winemaking process firsthand by participating in the grape harvesting and crushing process. These tours are usually offered during the grape harvesting season, which varies depending on the region and the type of grapes being harvested. Harvest experience tours can be a fun and educational way to learn about the winemaking process and to see behind the scenes at a working winery.

He is best known today for his historical work on the radical movements in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, in particular The Making of the English Working Class (1963). Thompson published biographies of William Morris (1955) and (posthumously) William Blake (1993) and was a prolific journalist and essayist. He published the novel The Sykaos Papers and a collection of poetry. His work is considered by some to have been among the most important contributions to labour history and social history in the latter twentieth-century, with a global impact, including on scholarship in Asia and Africa. In a 2011 poll by History Today magazine, he was named the second most important historian of the previous 60 years, behind only Fernand Braudel. Thompson was one of the principal intellectuals of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Although he left the party in 1956 due to its suppression of open debate over the Soviet invasion of Hungary, he nevertheless remained a \"historian in the Marxist tradition\", calling for a rebellion against Stalinism as a prerequisite for the restoration of communists' \"confidence in our own revolutionary perspectives\". Thompson played a key role in the first New Left in Britain in the late 1950s. He was a vociferous left-wing socialist critic of the Labour governments of 1964–70 and 1974–79, and an early and constant supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, becoming during the 1980s the leading intellectual light of the movement against nuclear weapons in Europe. Early life E. P. Thompson was born in Oxford to Methodist missionary parents: His father, Edward John Thompson (1886–1946), was a poet and admirer of the Nobel Prize–winning poet Tagore. His older brother was William Frank Thompson (1919–1944), a British officer in the Second World War, who was captured and shot aiding the Bulgarian anti-fascist partisans. Thompson attended two independent schools, The Dragon School in Oxford and Kingswood School in Bath. Like many he left school in 1941 to fight in the Second World War. He served in a tank unit in the Italian campaign, including at the fourth battle of Cassino. After his military service, he studied at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. In 1946, E. P. Thompson formed the Communist Party Historians Group with Christopher Hill, Eric Hobsbawm, Rodney Hilton, Dona Torr, and others. In 1952 they launched the influential journal Past and Present. Career William Morris Thompson's first major work of scholarship was his biography of William Morris, written while he was a member of the Communist Party. Subtitled From Romantic to Revolutionary, it was part of an effort by the Communist Party Historians' Group, inspired by Torr, to emphasise the domestic roots of Marxism in Britain",

It was also an attempt to take Morris back from the critics who for more than 50 years had emphasised his art and downplayed his politics. Although Morris's political work is well to the fore, Thompson also used his literary talents to comment on aspects of Morris's work, such as his early Romantic poetry, which had previously received relatively little consideration. As Thompson noted in his preface to the second edition (1976), the first edition (1955) appears to have received relatively little attention from the literary establishment because of its then-unfashionable Marxist point of view. However, the somewhat rewritten second edition was much better received. The first New Left After Nikita Khrushchev's \"secret speech\" to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1956, which revealed that the Soviet party leadership had long been aware of Stalin's crimes, Thompson (with John Saville and others) started a dissident publication inside the CP, called The Reasoner. Six months later, he and most of his comrades left the party in disgust at the Soviet invasion of Hungary. But Thompson remained what he called a \"socialist humanist\". With Saville and others, he set up the New Reasoner, a journal that sought to develop a democratic socialist alternative to what its editors considered the ossified official Marxism of the Communist and Trotskyist parties and the managerialist cold war social democracy of the Labour Party and its international allies. The New Reasoner was the most important organ of what became known as the \"New Left\", an informal movement of dissident leftists closely associated with the nascent movement for nuclear disarmament in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The New Reasoner combined with the Universities and Left Review to form New Left Review in 1960, though Thompson and others fell out with the group around Perry Anderson who took over the journal in 1962. The fashion ever since has been to describe the Thompson et al. New Left as \"the first New Left\" and the Anderson et al. group, which by 1968 had embraced Tariq Ali and various Trotskyists, as the second. Thompson subsequently allied himself with the annual Socialist Register publication. With Raymond Williams and Stuart Hall, he was one of the editors of the 1967 May Day Manifesto, one of the key left-wing challenges to the 1964–70 Labour government of Harold Wilson. The Making of the English Working Class Thompson's most influential work was and remains The Making of the English Working Class, published in 1963 while he was working at the University of Leeds. The massive book, over 800 pages, was a watershed in the foundation of the field of social history. By exploring the ordinary cultures of working people through their previously ignored documentary remains, Thompson told the forgotten history of the first working-class political left in the world in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. Reflecting on the importance of the book for its 50th anniversary, Emma Griffin explained that Thompson \"uncovered details about workshop",

He took what others had regarded as scraps from the archive and interrogated them for what they told us about the beliefs and aims of those who were not on the winning side. Here, then, was a book that rambled over aspects of human experience that had never before had their historian. The Making of the English Working Class had a profound effect on the shape of British historiography, and still endures as a staple on university reading lists more than 50 years after its first publication in 1963. Writing for the Times Higher Education in 2013, Robert Colls recalled the power of Thompson's book for his generation of young British leftists: I bought my first copy in 1968 – a small, fat bundle of Pelican with a picture of a Yorkshire miner on the front – and I still have it, bandaged up and exhausted by the years of labour. From the first of its 900-odd pages, I knew, and my friends at the University of Sussex knew, that this was something else. We talked about it in the bar and on the bus and in the refectory queue. Imagine that: young male students more interested in a book than in gooseberry tart and custard. In his preface to this book, E.P. Thompson set out his approach to writing history from below, \"I am seeking to rescue the poor stockinger, the Luddite cropper, the \"obsolete\" hand-loom weaver, the \"Utopian\" artisan, and even the deluded follower of Joanna Southcott, from the enormous condescension of posterity. Their crafts and traditions may have been dying. Their hostility to the new industrialism may have been backward-looking. Their communitarian ideals may have been fantasies. Their insurrectionary conspiracies may have been foolhardy. But they lived through these times of acute social disturbance, and we did not. Their aspirations were valid in terms of their own experience; and, if they were casualties of history, they remain, condemned in their own lives, as casualties.\" Thompson's thought was also original and significant because of the way he defined \"class.\" To Thompson, class was not a structure, but a relationship: By re-defining class as a relationship that changed over time, Thompson proceeded to demonstrate how class was worthy of historical investigation. He opened the gates for a generation of labour historians, such as David Montgomery and Herbert Gutman, who made similar studies of the American working classes. A major work of research and synthesis, the book was also important in historiographical terms: with it, Thompson demonstrated the power of a historical Marxism rooted in the experience of real flesh-and-blood workers. Thompson wrote the book while living in Siddal, Halifax, West Yorkshire and based some of the work on his experiences with the local Halifax population. In later essays, Thompson has emphasized that crime and disorder were characteristic responses of the working and lower classes to the oppressions imposed upon them. He argues that crime was defined and punished primarily as an activity that threatened the status, property and",

There was no interest in reforming the culprits, the goal being to deter through extremely harsh punishment. Time discipline Time discipline, as it pertains to sociology and anthropology, is the general name given to social and economic rules, conventions, customs, and expectations governing the measurement of time, the social currency and awareness of time measurements, and people's expectations concerning the observance of these customs by others. Thompson authored Time, Work-Discipline, and Industrial Capitalism, published in 1967, which posits that reliance on clock-time is a result of the European Industrial Revolution and that neither industrial capitalism nor the creation of the modern state would have been possible without the imposition of synchronic forms of time and work discipline. An accurate and precise record of time was not kept prior to the industrial revolution. The new clock-time imposed by government and capitalist interests replaced earlier, collective perceptions of time—such as natural rhythms of time like sunrise, sunset, and seasonal changes—that Thompson believed flowed from the collective wisdom of human societies. However, although it is likely that earlier views of time were imposed by religious and other social authorities prior to the industrial revolution, Thompson's work identified time discipline as an important concept for study within the social sciences. Thompson addresses the development of time as a measurement that has value and that can be controlled by social structures. As labor became more mechanized during the industrial revolution, time became more precise and standardized. Factory work changed the relationship that the capitalist and laborers had with time and the clock; clock time became a tool for social control. Capitalist interests demanded that the work of laborers be monitored accurately to ensure that cost of labor was to the maximum benefit of the capitalist. Freelance polemicist Thompson left the University of Warwick in protest at the commercialisation of the academy, documented in the book Warwick University Limited (1971). He continued to teach and lecture as a visiting professor, particularly in the United States. However, he increasingly worked as a freelance writer, contributing many essays to New Society, Socialist Register and historical journals. In 1978, he published The Poverty of Theory which attacked the structural Marxism of Louis Althusser and his followers in Britain on New Left Review (famously saying: \"...all of them are , unhistorical shit\"). The title echoes that of Karl Marx's 1847 polemic against Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, The Poverty of Philosophy; and that of philosopher Karl Popper's 1936 book The Poverty of Historicism. Thompson's polemic provoked a book-length response from Perry Anderson entitled Arguments Within English Marxism. During the late 1970s, Thompson acquired a large public audience as a critic of the then Labour government's disregard of civil liberties; his writings from this time are collected in Writing By Candlelight (1980). From 1981 onward, Thompson was a frequent contributor to the American magazine The Nation. Voice of the peace movement From 1980, Thompson was the most prominent intellectual of",

In Britain, his pamphlet Protest and Survive, a parody on the government leaflet Protect and Survive, played a major role in the revived strength of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Just as important, Thompson was, with Ken Coates, Mary Kaldor and others, an author of the 1980 Appeal for European Nuclear Disarmament, calling for a nuclear-free Europe from Poland to Portugal, which was the founding document of European Nuclear Disarmament. Confusingly, END was both a Europe-wide campaign that comprised a series of large public conferences (the END Conventions), and a small British pressure group. Thompson played a key role in both END and CND throughout the 1980s, speaking at many public meetings, corresponding with hundreds of fellow activists and sympathetic intellectuals, and doing more than his fair share of committee work. He had a particularly important part in opening a dialogue between the west European peace movement and dissidents in Soviet-dominated eastern Europe, particularly in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, for which he was denounced as a tool of American imperialism by the Soviet authorities. He wrote dozens of polemical articles and essays during this period, which are collected in the books Zero Option (1982) and The Heavy Dancers (1985). He also wrote an extended essay attacking the ideologists on both sides of the cold war, Double Exposure (1985) and edited a collection of essays opposing Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, Star Wars (1985). An excerpt from a speech given by Thompson featured in the computer game Deus Ex Machina (1984). Thompson's own haunting recitation of his 1950 poem of \"apocalyptic expectation, \"The Place Called Choice,\" appeared on the 1984 vinyl recording \"The Apocalypso\", by Canadian pop group Singing Fools, released by A&M Records. During the 1980s Thompson was also invited by Michael Eavis, who founded a local branch of CND, to speak at the Glastonbury Festival on several occasions after it became a fundraising event for the organisation: Thompson's speech at the 1983 edition of the festival, where he declared that the audience were part of an \"alternative nation\" of \" inventors, writers... theatre, musicians\" opposed to Margaret Thatcher and the tradition of \"moneymakers and imperialists\" which he identified her with, was named by Eavis as the best speech ever made at the festival. William Blake The last book Thompson finished was Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law (1993). The product of years of research and published shortly after his death, it shows how far Blake was inspired by dissident religious ideas rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the English civil war. Personal life In 1948 Thompson married Dorothy Towers, whom he met at Cambridge. A fellow left-wing historian, she wrote studies on women in the Chartist movement, and the biography Queen Victoria: Gender and Power; she was Professor of History at the University of Birmingham.

William Frank Thompson Thompson's older brother Frank (1920–1944) was also a member of the British Communist Party during the Second World War. A gifted linguist, Frank Thompson parachuted into fascist-occupied Bulgaria as part of a \"Phantom Brigade\" during Operation Mulligatawny. He supported the resistance as a liaison officer but was captured and on 10 June 1944 he was executed. His body was buried in the War Cemetery of Sofia. After the war, the Bulgarians erected a statue in his honour. The nearby villages of Livage, Lipata, Tsarevi Stragi, Malak Babul, Babul and Zavoya were merged and renamed to Thompson in his honour. E. P. Thompson and his mother wrote There is a Spirit in Europe: A Memoir of Frank Thompson (1947). Frank Thompson was also a friend and confidant of Iris Murdoch, the philosopher and novelist. E. P. Thompson wrote another book about his brother, published in 1996. Criticism Although Thompson left the Communist Party of Great Britain, he remained committed to Marxist ideals. Leszek Kołakowski wrote a very harsh criticism of Thompson in his 1974 essay \"My Correct Views on Everything\". Tony Judt considered this rejoinder so authoritative that he claimed that \"no one who reads it will ever take E.P. Thompson seriously again\". Kołakowski's portrait of Thompson elicited some protests from readers and other left-wing journals came to Thompson's defence. On the 50th anniversary of the landmark publication of The Making of the English Working Class, journalists celebrated E.P. Thompson as one of the pre-eminent historians of his day. As Marxist history became less fashionable in the face of the adaptation of discourse-focused approaches inspired by the linguistic turn and post-structuralism in the 1980s, Thompson's work was subjected to critique by fellow historians. Joan Wallach Scott argued that Thompson's approach in The Making of the English Working Class was androcentric, and ignored the centrality of gender in the construction of class identities, with the sphere of paid labour in which economic class was rooted being understood as inherently male and privileged over the feminised domestic realm. Sheila Rowbotham, also a feminist historian and a friend of E.P. and Dorothy Thompson, has argued that Scott's critique was ahistorical, given that the book was published in 1963, before the second-wave feminist movement had fully developed a theoretical gender perspective. In a 2020 interview, Rowbotham acknowledged that \"there was not a great deal of reference to women in The Making... But at the time it seemed like there were a lot of references to women, because we had to read people like J. H. Plumb — history in which there were really absolutely no women at all\", and suggested that Thompson limited his writing about woman in deference to his wife, for whom women's history was a key area of research interest. Rowbotham did acknowledge that whilst they supported the emancipation of women, the Thompsons had mixed feelings about the contemporary second-wave feminist movement, regarding it as too middle class.

Gareth Stedman Jones claimed that the conception of the role of experience in The Making of the English Working Class embodied the idea of a direct link between social being and social consciousness, ignoring the importance of discourse as a means of mediating between the two, enabling people to develop a political understanding of the world and orientating them to political action. Marc Steinberg argued that Stedman Jones' interpretation of Thompson's perspective was \"reductionist\", with Thompson understanding the relationship between experience and consciousness as a \"complex dialectical relationship\". Wade Matthews argued in 2013: Numerous books, special collections, and journal articles on E.P. Thompson's scholarly work and legacy appeared soon after his death in 1993. Since then, however, interest in Thompson has waned. The reasons for this are perhaps easily enough summarized. Today, Thompson's histories are viewed as old-fashioned, while his socialist politics are believed extinct. Class is considered neither a fruitful concept of historical analysis nor an appropriate basis for an emancipatory politics. Nuclear weapons proliferate, but no anti-nuclear movement grows up alongside their proliferation. Civil liberties are a minority, and increasingly \"radical,\" interest in the age of the \"war on terror.\" Internationalism, as ideology and practice, is the preserve of capital not labour. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, then, Thompson seems out of place. ...certainly part of his distinctiveness lay in his literary style and tone. But it also lay in the moral quality which undergirded his histories and his political interventions. Part of that quality was the \"glimpses of other possibilities of human nature, other ways of behaving\" that they gave us. In this way, as Stefan Collini has suggested, Thompson is perhaps more relevant than he ever was. Honours A blue plaque to the Thompsons was erected by the Halifax Civic Trust.

The duo consists of Anjali Hursh (DJ Anjali) and Stephen Strausbaugh (The Incredible Kid). In addition to appearing at various venues in Portland's nightclub scene, the act has performed in numerous music festivals and resident nights including Sasquatch! Music Festival and Basement Bhangra and is credited with helping to bring South Asian and Latin dance music to the club scene in Portland and the greater Pacific Northwest. Together they host Tropitaal, a \"Desi-Latino Soundclash\" and Andaz, the longest-running Bhangra and Bollywood dance party in the United States. The duo was awarded first place in the \"Best DJ\" category of \"Best of Portland\" by Willamette Week readers in 2016 and 2017. History Hursh and Strausbaugh first crossed paths in the late 90's when they both became involved in union organizing while working at Powell's Books. At the time Strausbaugh was playing sets at private parties and providing entertainment at pro-union events. After collaborating on several such events, the two formed a partnership and made their first foray into the nightclub scene in 2000, hosting a successful new years party at Medicine Hat. This was followed by brief stints at The Blackbird and Lola's Room, until 2002 when they took over a monthly night at Fez Ballroom, the venue that would become home to their Andaz party for the next 7.5 years. Since departing from that venue in April 2010, editions of Andaz have been held at Star Theater, The Analog, and The Liquor Store and have routinely drawn crowds of 300 people. In 2003, they teamed up with DJ E3 to form Atlas, a dance party that combined their South Asian format with a more broadly international sound that included Dancehall, Reggaeton, Baile Funk,",

It was published in hardcover in 2003 by Scribner, then in March 2004 by Pocket Books, a division of Simon & Schuster, Inc. The book was sold as Dark Matter in Australia. It made The New York Times Best Seller List. Plot summary The story revolves around a supercomputer being built in a secret government lab working on a project called Trinity. When one of the project's scientists dies, David Tennant, the ethical caretaker, discovers that he had been killed for his refusal to accept the project's ultimate aim; a merger of the human mind and the machine, in order to produce an unrivalled super computing machine. Tennant subsequently tries to piece together the truth behind the project while he and his psychiatrist Dr. Rachel Weiss are pursued around the globe. Tennant suffers from a series of regression episodes, which are considered to be seizures by his doctor, who says they are caused by overexposure to a super-MRI scan. During these episodes, he has strangely vivid dreams, in which he witnesses the beginning of the universe (the Big Bang) and the history of mankind. Subsequent dreams seem to be memories of Jesus of Nazareth, something that Tennant, an atheist, finds strange and bewildering. They take a bizarre turn when he sees himself as an NSA assassin sent to kill him, and also as his dead friend, Andrew Fielding, in his last moments In the end, it seems that someone was in fact showing him these dreams, to tell him",

The majority of these changes took place in the 1960s and early 1970s, however the plan, by now much modified in the face of rapidly dwindling freight traffic, was not fully realised until the 1980s. History In the 1960s, the Sheffield area was one of the busiest areas in the country for rail traffic, in particular for freight traffic: a British Rail Board report showed that 10% of the country's rail freight emanated from the Sheffield area. The facilities that existed, however, were built by competing railway companies in the 19th century and were cramped and outmoded. In an era of central government economic planning this was seen as a constraint on Britain's economic growth; government money was made available to relieve these bottlenecks. At the same time, passenger facilities in Sheffield were to be made more convenient, representing the need for faster and more frequent trains on fewer routes stopping at fewer intermediate stations, but allowing more convenient changing between trains for the remaining local and long-distance express trains. The Plan The major part of the rationalisation plan involved: The concentration of passenger services on Sheffield Midland and the closure of Sheffield Victoria. The closure of Rotherham Central and the concentration of services on Rotherham Masborough. The concentration of parcels traffic and goods transshipment on a new 'Sheffield Freight Terminal' built on a site adjacent to the former Midland Railway locomotive sheds at Grimesthorpe. The construction of a new marshalling yard at Tinsley (Tinsley Marshalling Yard) to replace many small yards around South Yorkshire. The construction of a Freightliner depot on the site of the former Masborough Sorting Sidings in Rotherham. The upgrading of signalling to multiple-aspect signalling or MAS. Details Passenger services In 1965, Sheffield Midland station's exterior was cleaned for the first time 95 years. At the same time, Sheaf House, new home of British Rail Sheffield Division headquarters were opened. Sheaf House stood on the site of the former Pond Street Goods station closed in 1963. Midland Main Line services South were improved with hourly workings (alternatively via Nottingham or Derby) from 1966 with departure times scheduled just past the hour. Cross-country passenger services from the North-East to the South-West were transformed with services running via Sheffield Victoria station rerouted to Sheffield Midland. Services via Retford and the ECML to London King's Cross were stopped and all London trains routed via the Midland Main Line to London St Pancras.

Stopping trains on the former Midland main line north of Rotherham were also axed in January 1968 and many South Yorkshire stations closed: all Leeds-bound stopping services were diverted to run via Chapeltown and Barnsley replacing the short distance Sheffield-Barnsley and Barnsley-Wakefield stopping trains on this line; York-bound services became semi-fast with Bolton-on-Dearne being the only South Yorkshire station north of Rotherham remaining open on that line. The Nunnery Curve built in 1870 was upgraded and brought into passenger use, allowing trains arriving in Sheffield from the East over former Great Central lines to access Sheffield Midland. Passenger services to Lincoln, Doncaster, Hull, Grimsby and Cleethorpes were moved from Sheffield Victoria to Midland. It had been suggested that after the closure of Victoria the electrification be extended to Sheffield Midland from the Woodhead Line, but this was dismissed as being too expensive and the Woodhead became a freight only line under the 1984 Trunk Route Plan. All Manchester services were consequently diverted to the Hope Valley Line; electrified passenger services ended on 5 January 1970 and Sheffield Victoria station closed. After closure the Sheffield to Huddersfield service continued to pass through Victoria by reversing at Woodburn Junction. This service was diverted via Barnsley in 1983 by an initiative of the SYPTE who agreed to subsidise the diversion (see Penistone line). The operation was a success and the diverted service was kept, resulting in subsequent station re-openings at Silkstone and Dodworth, which had both closed in 1959. Victoria station was demolished in 1989. Freight traffic Pond Street Goods station closed on 7 October 1961, Queens Road Goods station on 11 May 1963 and Park Goods station in October 1963. Work on Sheffield freight terminal at Grimesthorpe began at the end of 1963. A third Western entrance to Tinsley Yard over Shepcote Lane was opened in summer 1964 and was electrified. Followed the opening of Grimesthorpe in summer 1965. In order to allow goods trains reach the new Tinsley Marshalling Yard from the north a scissors junction, Aldwarke Junction, was constructed near Parkgate, North of Rotherham. This also enabled passenger trains to reach Sheffield Midland station from the Great Central route following the closure of the Swinton Curve. New lines were constructed from the Great Central in the Attercliffe/Broughton Lane area to reach the Sheffield District Railway and access to Tinsley Marshalling yard. Dr Beeching opened both complexes on 29 October. Locomotive and train servicing Between 1961 and 1965 the fleet of steam locomotives in the Sheffield area was gradually withdrawn and replaced with new diesel locomotives and multiple units. Millhouse's engine shed was the first to close. Grimesthorpe lost its steam locomotives but became the temporary home to the new diesel locomotive fleet pending the opening of the new shed at Tinsley. This new depot, which could service both diesel and electric locomotives opened in February 1964. This resulted in the closure of Grimesthorpe and the steam/electric depot at Darnall, which became a wagon-repair depot and stabling point for",

Barrow Hill and Canklow lost their allocation of steam locomotives in 1965; the former remained open up to February 1991 as a stabling point for diesel locomotives and the latter remained open for servicing visiting steam locomotives until the numbers of these dwindled in 1966 with withdrawals elsewhere. All remaining servicing of passenger trains was done at Nunnery carriage sidings, or at Midland station itself in the through roads or on the former Pond Street goods depot. Multiple-aspect signalling The multiple-aspect signalling scheme, or MAS, was the two-stage introduction of multiple-aspect light signalling in the Sheffield area, which began in 1971. The scheme began with the reduction of the quadruple track between Sheffield Midland and Dore & Totley and the simplification of the up entrance to Sheffield Midland. The reduction in track was completed by January 1972 with the closure of Dore West and Dore South signal boxes. The dive under built in 1900 was taken out of use from 25 June 1972. There, the track was reduced from four to three and to two between Heeley and Dore & Totley. A passing loop was kept between Heeley and Millhouses. Sheffield Power Box was commissioned between 20 and 22 January 1973. The new box replaced Sheffield station signal boxes A, B, North, South 1 and South 2, as well as Queens Road, Heeley station, Heeley carriage sidings and Millhouses. The end of stage I of the MAS scheme was announced in June. Between 20 January and 22 January 1973 Sheffield Victoria station was temporarily reopened while Midland station was completely closed for commissioning of the new power box. Only the main up and down platforms were used as the loop platforms had already been lifted. The station was still complete but the electrics were deemed beyond help so the station was strung with light bulbs strung through the station roofing. Trains to Manchester went via Woodhead although diesel traction was used rather than electric working. Stage II of the MAS was completed on 14 January 1979 when Wincobank signal box was closed. The boxes at Holmes, Masborough and Canklow closed in July 1979 followed on 16 May 1982 by Beighton Junction. Track work at Treeton was realigned and simplified and both boxes, Treeton Junction and Treeton South were closed in October 1982. At that point all Midland lines had been converted to MAS. The Sheffield to Lincoln line is however still operational using semaphore signals controlled by Woodhouse Junction signal box. The resignalling project was completed to encompass Chesterfield, Rotherham and lines north of Sheffield as far as Thurnscoe, Conisbrough, Darfield and Wath. The outcome today As with much of the BR Modernisation Plan, a lot of expenditure was made in upgrading facilities to deal with wagonload freight and heavy industry traffic that would rapidly become obsolete. Tinsley Yard was never used to its full capacity, and although it remained impressively busy until the early 1980s it was almost defunct by the mid-1990s along with its locomotive depot.

The Darnall wagon-repair depot closed in the mid-1980s with the run-down of freight in the area. Nunnery carriage sidings also closed in the mid-1980s with the introduction of High Speed Trains on the Midland Main Line, which required less servicing, all of which was done from Leeds Neville Hill. After that time all remaining passenger train stabling and servicing was done at Midland station or outside the area; this was becoming increasingly problematic in the early 21st century leading to plans to re-open a Traincare Depot in the Sheffield area. The decision to concentrate Rotherham's traffic on Masborough station was a mistake, which lead to declining passenger numbers. This was rectified in 1987 with the switching of Rotherham's passenger traffic to a brand new Central station on the site of its predecessor and, later, the closure of Masborough, albeit via a low-cost single line connection that is now seen to be a bottleneck. A general increase in passenger numbers in the area since the 1980s has shown that, with hindsight, many of the suburban and urban station closures were premature. The stations at Meadowhall (on the site of the former Wincobank station) and Swinton, closed in the 1960s, were re-opened in 1990. Millhouses has been repeatedly put forward as a candidate for re-opening, with line capacity constraints usually cited as a confounding factor; indeed it is notable that the rationalised track layout to the south of Sheffield Midland that was enabled by the closure of the southern suburban stations is now cited as a major bottleneck The re-opening of stations at Ecclesfield, Parkgate and Wath-upon-Dearne has also been mooted.

The Viceroy hints of his intention to give the coach to his mistress, the Marquise, but has decided to pay for it with public funds, since he plans to use it to overawe the populace and flatter the local nobility, who enthusiastically look forward to taking turns parading in it. By coincidence, the coach arrives on the same ship that carries an Italian commedia dell'arte troupe composed of men, women and children who perform as singers, actors, acrobats and comics. The troupe is led by Don Antonio, who also portrays the stock character of Pantalone on stage, and features Camilla, who plays the stock role of Columbina. Once members of the troupe refurbish the town's dilapidated theater, their performances meet with success only after local hero, Ramon, a toreador, becomes smitten with Camilla and starts leading the applause. Similarly, after a command performance at the Viceroy's palace, the gentry withhold their favor until the Viceroy signals his approval and asks to meet the women of the company. He, too, is taken with Camilla, who is the only person who makes him feel comfortable and light-hearted. He gives her a splendid necklace, which enrages her jealous suitor, Felipe, who has been accompanying the troupe on their travels. Felipe attacks Camilla and causes a riotous backstage brawl, after which he runs off to join the army. The Viceroy has become infatuated with Camilla and announces that he has decided to pay for the coach with his own money, in order to give it to her as a love gift. This outrages the Marquise along with the rest of the nobility, who are already smarting over the Viceroy's demands for money to finance military defenses against an insurgency. Led by the Duc de Castro, they threaten to strip the Viceroy of his post, an action that can only succeed if endorsed by the country's Bishop. When the Viceroy vacillates in the face of this intimidation, Camilla spurns him in disgust. After watching a triumphant performance by Ramon in the bullring, Camilla impetuously gives him her necklace, which emboldens him to visit her lodging that night and propose that they become a celebrity couple in order to enhance their earning power as performers. There he encounters Felipe, who has returned from extended army service in order to reclaim Camilla and take her away with him to live a simple life among the natives.

Renoir let his assistant director Marc Maurette direct the dubbing in French. The French version was the first to appear in theaters. An Italian version was also made. Renoir repeatedly preferred the English version: it was the only one to be restored in 2012. François Truffaut reportedly referred to The Golden Coach as \"the noblest and most refined film ever made\". \"In its own time, The Golden Coach was an international failure in all three language versions with both the critics and the public.\" \"Seen today by the international community of cinephiles as a truly 'beauteous' and 'ravishing' comic fantasy from Jean Renoir's late period, The Golden Coach can best be appreciated as an illustrious filmmaker's elegant tribute to the theater. The 'comedy'... is based... on a clear-eyed vision of art's denial of 'normal' life. Instead of seeking the nonexistent 'psychology' of the characters, one must follow the flowing images as a mobile painting driven by Magnani and Vivaldi across the canvas of an Italianate spectacle. Eric Rohmer has described The Golden Coach as 'the open sesame' of all Renoir's work The two customary poles of his work—art and nature, acting and life—take shape in two facing mirrors, which reflect each other's images back and forth until it is impossible to tell where one ends and the other begins.\" References External links The Golden Coach an essay by Andrew Sarris at the Criterion Collection 1952 films 1950s French-language films 1950s adventure comedy films Films based on works by Prosper Mérimée Films directed by Jean Renoir Films set in the 18th century Films set in Peru English-language French films English-language Italian films French films based on plays 1952 comedy films 1950s English-language filmsBrévillers may refer to: Brévillers, Pas-de-Calais, a commune in France Brévillers, Somme, a commune in France See also Bréville (disambiguation)The 1923–24 Swiss International Ice Hockey Championship was the ninth edition of the international ice hockey championship in Switzerland.

In contrast to the traditional beko, a spiritual chant sung at funerals to honor the life of the deceased, Salala adapted the harmonies and style of the genre while shedding the religious purpose of the music by focusing the subject of their songs on matters of daily life. The group was founded by one of the singers, M'Bassa, in 1983, with singer Senge and a friend. All three performers belong to the southern Antandroy ethnic group and originate from a small village near Taolagnaro. Over the next ten years, the group gained in popularity in Madagascar, eventually winning the \"Gasitsara Media Prize\" for Best Band of the Year. Their first major domestic hit was \"Salakao Raho Ene\". The group went on to perform the Africolor music festival in 1994, where they were well received. In 1995 they recorded their first album, Salala, and were selected to represent the Indian Ocean states at the \"Découvertes du Printemps de Bourges\" tour, performing at 25 venues across France and Germany with Oumou Sangaré. After this success, the group's bass vocalist, Senge, launched a solo career, eventually teaming up with two other singers to lead his own trio, while still performing and recording with Salala. The band toured Africa in 1996, visiting the Seychelles, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Malawi, Zambia, Namibia and South Africa. They performed at the third Jeux de la Francophonie in Madagascar in 1997 and toured Singapore in 1998. In 1999, Salala toured Reunion island with Granmoun Lélé. Salala released their second and last album, Benaombe, in 2000, just prior to the death of Senge following a battle with cancer. Since Senge's death, the band has regularly performed around the world. From 2001 to 2004, the group promoted their second album with regular performances across Madagascar. From 2005 to 2007, M'Bassa partnered with the Alliance Francaise of Madagascar to promote southern music in association with Francis Cabrel's \"Voix du Sud\" project, performing at Alliance Francaise centers throughout the island and in Burundi The band toured Madagascar and France in 2008, and returned to tour France again in 2010.

He designed fighter aircraft and air racers, as well as airplanes for postal delivery and medical transport. He also designed racing cars and land-speed record cars for Panhard and Renault. Riffard has been called the \"Father of modern aviation\". Early years On 14 July 1883, French engineer Edmond Riffard arrived in Argentina with his wife Gabrielle Guy de Riffard and their son Pablo. The family settled in Villa Ocampo, Santa Fe Province. Edmond had moved to Argentina to build the Tacuarendí sugar mill, but while there he also introduced both the telephone and paper money to the country, and partnered with Frenchman George Brosset to establish the French Chaco Distillery. While in Argentina the Riffards had two more children; Irma, in 1885, and Marcel, on 30 November 1886. One year after the Baring crisis of 1890, the family returned to France, arriving on 14 July 1893. Eventually there were five siblings in the family. Riffard attended school at the Lycée J.B. Dumas in Alès. During the mathematics portion of the 1903 Concours général, he provided seven solutions to a problem for which Henri Poincaré had only given five. For this he won the Grande Médaille d'Argent, the Prix de la Société Scientifique et Littéraire, and the Premier Prix au Concours Généraux, Section Mathématiques. He also pursued athletics, going to Paris in July 1905 for the Critérium Interscolaire d'Athlétisme, where he finished third. Riffard studied in preparation for admission to l'École nationale supérieure des mines de Saint-Étienne at the Lycée Carnot in the city of Saint-Étienne but did not pursue a Grande école. Instead he worked for tire manufacturer La Société des Pneumatiques Samson from October 1905 to October 1907. From 10 October 1907 until 28 September 1909 Riffard performed his national military service with the 38th field artillery regiment, assigned to the 7th battery detachment in Bastia, Corsica.

The craft was shown without an engine in September 1908, and was flown by Guillaume Busson in the Bétheny competition in August 1909. In 1909, Riffard developed a scale model of an electrically controlled variable-pitch propeller. On 1 January 1910, Riffard conceived of and designed the first aircraft built entirely of metal. This pusher monoplane used pressed steel for the structure and aluminum for the skin. It was built in collaboration with aviators Georges Legagneux and Robert Martinet. It may have only been ground tested. In 1912 Riffard designed the first medical aircraft, built with the help of Legagneux and Martinet. He also invented an anti-icing device and a thermoregulator flap for water-cooled engines. On 2 August 1914, Riffard was recalled to active military duty with the 38th artillery regiment, and in 1916 was transferred to the Groupe Aviation du Bourget. Louis Bréguet Aviation In 1917 Riffard moved to Bréguet Aviation, established by Louis Charles Bréguet at Villacoublay. Riffard was head of the Bréguet Design Office at Vélizy until 1923. One of his first projects was to adapt an early turbocharger from the company founded by Auguste Rateau to the Bréguet 14. RM-1 At Bréguet in 1917, Riffard and Gabriel Mollard worked on a design for a rocket-powered military biplane called the RM-1. Its chief armament was a single rocket-propelled missile. Leviathan Riffard designed the quad-engined Leviathan XXII, and developed the engage/disengage mechanism that allowed one engine in each of the dual-engine Bréguet-Bugatti assemblies to be shut down while the other continued to drive the shared propeller. Louis de Monge From 1923 to 1926, Riffard was the technical director for the company run by Belgian engineer Louis de Monge at Issy-les-Moulineaux. He designed two fighter aircraft while with de Monge, but the company failed before they could be produced. He also designed a tri-engined transatlantic flying wing passenger transport that progressed to the flying model stage. Lioré et Olivier In 1926, Riffard became head of the Clichy design office of Société de Constructions Aéronautiques d'Hydravions Lioré et Olivier, a flying boat builder based in Levallois-Perret. He remained there until 1930. While there he contributed to the design of several aircraft, including the LeO.122, LeO.20, LeO H-18, LeO H-180, LeO H-24, and the LeO H-242. Marcel Bloch From 1930 to 1931, Riffard was the general manager of Société des Avions Marcel Bloch. While with Marcel Bloch, he completed a design that had been started by Bloch's previous designer Pineau, resulting in the Bloch MB.60. Bloch later changed his last name to Dassault, and his company became Avions Marcel Dassault. Omnium Métallurgique Industriel From 1931 to 1932, Riffard worked at Omnium Métallurgique Industriel (OMI), an engine builder whose products for motorcycles and aircraft were sold under the Chaise name. At OMI, Riffard was tasked with testing their first inverted cylinder aircraft engine.

Caudron Riffard became Technical Director and Chief Engineer of l'Association Aéroplanes Caudron Frères, at 52 rue Guynemer in Issy-les-Moulineaux on 1 March 1932.\" Otfinovsky moved to Caudron at or near the same time. In 1933, Pierre Cot, the Ministre de l'Air of France, asked Renault to assume control of Caudron. When Renault acquired control of Caudron, Riffard was part of the deal. La Société Anonyme des Avion Caudron, commonly called Caudron-Renault, was established on 30 June 1933. Riffard's sojourn at Caudron was a productive time for him, resulting in 73 prototypes. Several of the aircraft designed by Riffard for Caudron featured a wing design called the \"aile crocodile\" (\"crocodile wing\"), which had intrados flaps with split trailing edges. Riffard's aircraft designs for Caudron include the following: Simoun Riffard designed the Simoun, a series of four-place monoplanes that were popular as private tourers, mail service carriers, and military liaison aircraft. The name is French for the \"Simoom\" wind that blows across the Eastern Mediterranean and Arabic Peninsula. The first flight of a Simoun took place in 1934. The Air Bleu service began on 10 July 1935 from Le Bourget, using Caudron Simouns to transfer mail across France. In December 1935 Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and André Prévot piloted the Simoun C.630 with registry F-ANRY in the Paris-to-Saïgon air race. The pair crashed in the Sahara desert, and were eventually rescued by Bedouin tribesmen. Saint-Exupéry later wrote about the experience in his 1939 book \"Wind, Sand and Stars\", and used it as the inspiration for his novella, \"The Little Prince\". In 1936 Saint-Exupéry acquired the Caudron Simoun C.635 registered F-ANXK. He crashed this plane in Guatemala, and remained in a coma for eight days. On 30 December 1936, at 7:23am, French pilot Maryse Bastié took off from Dakar in a modified Caudron Simoun C.635, registered F-ANXO, that she had christened \"Jean Mermoz\" for the deceased aviator. When she landed in Natal, Brazil twelve hours and five minutes later, she set a new record for fastest crossing of the Atlantic ocean at an average speed of . On 19 December 1937, pilot Maryse Hilsz took off from Istres in a Simoun C.635 registered F-AQDY with the goal of setting a new distance record. To reduce fuel consumption, the original 6Q engine was replaced by a less powerful engine from the C.620. Forced to land in Alexandria, she still beat a previous record set by André Japy in a Caudron Aiglon. From December 29 to 30, 1938, Hilsz set a new distance record for Class C aircraft by flying from Istres to Port-Etienne, Mauritania.

Popular with private owners and flying clubs, several Aiglons were requisitioned by the French government during WWI, with some serving as liaison aircraft. Typhon The Caudron C.640 Typhon was a general use monoplane designed primarily as a long-distance postal carrier. It first flew in 1935. C.710 series This was a series of fighter aircraft designed by Riffard that included the C.714 Cyclone. The prototype, model C.710, first flew on 18 July 1936. Air racers Some of the most famous aircraft designed by Riffard at Caudron were the air racers. Some series included both racing and fighter models. Among the racers, three different series of tandem two-seat Grand Sport aircraft were named Rafale, which means \"gust\" in French. Caudron racing aircraft made several appearances in the Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe air race, and came to dominate the third series of these competitions that began in 1933. During the pre-race trials for the 1933 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe, pilot Ludovic Arrachart was killed when his Caudron C.360 crashed at Maisons near Chartres. Raymond Delmotte's Caudron C.362 took second place in the race with a speed of . In the 1934 Coupe, Caudrons finished 1-2-3, with Maurice Arnoux first in a Caudron C.450 at , Louis Masotte second in a Caudron C.366 Atalante at , and Albert Monville third in a Caudron C.460 at . In the 1935 race, Riffard-designed planes finished first and second, with Yves Lacombe first in a Caudron C.450 with a speed of , ahead of Maurice Arnoux second in a Caudron C.461 in with a speed of . In the fourth Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe held in 1936, the only planes entered were Caudrons. Five were entered, but only three competed. After staging an air race between French aviators Hilsz and Hélène Boucher on 12 June 1934, Caudron signed Boucher on as their factory pilot. Already the holder of a Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) altitude record, Boucher went on to fly a variety of Riffard-designed Caudron aircraft, including the C.430, C.450 and C.530. On 8 July 1934, Boucher and her passenger Marie-Louise Becker placed second in the Douze Heures d'Angers in a Caudron C.530 registered F-ANAO, behind the team of Lacombe and Trivier, also in a Caudron. During this race Boucher broke the women's and men's speed record over 1,000 km in a light aircraft with a speed of .

The Rafale faced American aircraft with engines having more than double the displacement and power of the French plane. Other Caudron designs Riffard also designed the 1936 Caudron C.690 flight trainer and 1938 Caudron C.860 long range military communications aircraft. Bureau Secret Clandestin in Boulogne-Billancourt and Société Rateau From 1 August 1940 to 31 May 1944, during the German occupation of France, Riffard worked with both the Bureau Secret Clandestin at Boulogne-Billancourt and the Société Rateau in La Courneuve. It was this period that Riffard, working with Otfinosvsky, created designs for two jet aircraft; one with a single engine, the other a twin-engine fighter jet. Engines were expected to be supplied by Rateau. In 1942 he conceived both of an aircraft capable of carrying up to forty passengers across the Atlantic at speeds of , and of a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) craft powered by two engines that rotated between vertical and horizontal positions. Société Nationale Aéronautique du Centre From 1944 to 1949, Riffard continued to serve as a consulting engineer for the Société Rateau, as well as for the Société Nationale Aéronautique du Centre (SNAC). He was a consulting engineer on the first French jet aircraft ever built, the SO.6000 Triton. In the Spring of 1943 Lucien Servanty at SNAC resumed Riffard and Otfinovsky's earlier work on jet aircraft, while René Anxionnaz at Rateau developed the SRA-1 jet engine. The SO.6000 had its maiden flight on 11 November 1946, becoming the first French designed and built jet to fly. Five were built. Sud Aviation In the early 1960s, Riffard became a technical adviser to the Société nationale des constructions aéronautiques du sud-ouest, commonly known as Sud Aviation. Riffard was involved in the company's efforts to address deficiencies in the recently developed SNCASE SE.3200 Frelon (\"Hornet\") helicopter, which had not progressed past a few prototypes due to poor performance. He revised the shape of the body and glass of the craft, and had all minor raised surfaces smoothed. The result was the Sud Aviation SA 321 Super Frelon. The Super Frelon's maiden flight was on 7 December 1962. On 23 July 1963, it set a new speed record for rotorcraft at a speed of . In 1970, the merger of Sud-Aviation, the Société nationale de constructions aéronautiques Nord-Aviation, and the Société d'étude et de réalisation d'engins balistiques resulted in a new entity, the Société Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale (SNIAS), or simply Aérospatiale. Bicycles Riffard was involved in the design of at least two aerodynamic bicycle projects. Vélo-Torpille Étienne Bunau-Varilla was the son of a French engineer who had made his fortune working on the abortive French Panama Canal project. After completing his Baccalauréat, the younger Bunau-Varilla was given an airplane as a gift, and participated in some air races. He later started racing bicycles, and",

Riffard designed a narrow, tapering dirigible-shaped fairing made of wood and celluloid that covered the rider's entire body except for his lower legs. The completed assembly weighed The shape of the bike and fairing earned it the nickname \"l'Oeuf de Berthet\" — Berthet's egg. Marcel Berthet was a cyclist who had set several world kilometre records, and who rode the bike during its record attempts. In 1913 Berthet covered one kilometre in 1 minute 04 seconds in the Vélo-Torpille at the Parc des Princes stadium. Later, at the Vélodrome d'Hiver, he reduced his time to 1 minute 02 seconds, setting a new Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) record. The UCI refused to recognize the feat because of Riffard's fairing. Vélodyne Working just with Berthet, Riffard helped design another fairing-covered bicycle called the Vélodyne. This cycle had a reversed front fork, and front wheel smaller than the rear. The frame was made of aluminum, while the fairing was of spruce and magnolia wood covered in canvas. Total weight was . The fairing, which extended almost to the ground, opened on the side to admit the rider. It was built by the Caudron Aircraft Company. On 9 September 1933, Berthet covered in one hour at the Parc des Princes, beating the standing record. Two months later Berthet took the Vélodyne out on the l'Autodrome de Linas-Montlhéry and increased his distance to for the hour. Neither of these forays were recognized by the UCI. Automobiles Riffard designed aerodynamic bodywork for several automobiles, including at least one production sports car, several endurance racers, and some land speed record attempt cars. Renault Rafale Riffard contributed to the design of a concept car called the Renault Rafale. Unveiled in 1934, this car was the precursor to the Renault Vivastella Grand Sport launched the same year. Renault Viva Grand Sport In 1934 Renault debuted their Vivastella Grand Sport, with a body designed by Riffard. The car was renamed the Renault Viva Grand Sport the next year. Riffard applied his experience designing aircraft to the car's body shape. The car debuted at the 1934 Salon de Paris, alongside the Nervastella, and was built by Renault between 1934 and 1939. At , the car is wide enough to seat three people abreast. It is powered by an inline six-cylinder engine displacing , mounted lengthwise at the front. Renault hired celebrity aviator and Caudron-Renault factory pilot Hélène Boucher to promote the Viva Grand Sport. Nervasport des Records About six years after setting land speed records with its streamlined Type NM 40CV single-seater, Renault decided to pursue new land speed records with a tuned Nervastella at Monthléry in March 1932. For the next attempt Renault commissioned l'atelier 153, a dedicated workshop within Renault under the direction of Auguste Riolfo that handled testing new models and special projects, to build a dedicated land speed racer. The car was based on a standard Nervasport chassis, but with a custom body designed by Riffard and made of hand-hammered metal supported by a",

The drivers selected for the run were Roger Quatresous, Léo Fromentin, André Wagner, and Georges Berthelon, who also served as garage manager. Each driver rotated in three-hour shifts. The record attempt started at Monthléry on 3 April 1934 at 3:37 pm, and continued until just before 4:00 pm, 5 April 1934. The attempt set three world records and nine international records for cars with engines displacing , including the 48-hour speed record, with an average speed of . New average speed records were also set for distances. On the eightieth anniversary of the Nervasport's record-breaking run, and in advance of their 110th anniversary of motorsports activity, Renault commissioned a replica of the 1934 Nervasport des Records be built. The first sketches of the car were done in 2014, and the completed replica debuted on the Montlhérey circuit in June 2016. Vivasport des Records The records set by the Nervasport des Records did not stand long. On 8 May 1934, at 4:00 pm, a streamlined single-seat Delahaye appeared at Monthléry and raised the record average speed to just over , and set a new record for the distance. Renault's response was to build a new land speed car. The new car's bodywork was once again designed by Riffard, and construction was handled by l'atelier 153. This car was based on the chassis of a Renault Vivasport, and used that model's inline six-cylinder engine. Its long nose and ovoid front air intake were reminiscent of the Nervasport car, but the canopy over the driver reflected Riffard's aviation background, with a wrap-around windscreen and a roofline that dropped down much more sharply than the roofline of the Nervasport des Records, with no fin. The car began its record attempt on 13 August 1934. At 7:45 pm Quatresous took the first shift, and was replaced by Fromentin at 10:45 pm, and then Berthelon at 1:45 am. At 3:30 am there was an accident that resulted in the car being destroyed in an explosion and subsequent fire, while Berthelon was thrown out of the car to his death. Renault-Riffard Riffard designed new aero bodywork for a car known as the Renault-Riffard Tank sometime between 1950 and 1954. Built on the chassis of an existing race car called the Guépard, this compact barquette had full-width \"tank\" style bodywork with the side profile of an airfoil cross-section.

Driven by Lucien Bianchi and Christian Poirot, it finished eleventh in class, and twenty-first overall. Panhard X cars In 1953 Panhard decided to become directly involved in racing. Paul Panhard established a racing team under director Etienne de Valance. During World War II (WWII), René Panhard had flown Caudron-Renault fighters, and he contacted Riffard to design their new endurance racers. Riffard produced designs for two of three of Panhard's own endurance racers; the X88, and X89. As there were no corresponding Dyna X series X88 or X89, these designations were specific to the racing cars built by Panhard. Panhard X88 Riffard's original 1953 Le Mans barquette bodywork was wide and low, with a flat tapering tail. The car's chassis was of light alloy, with bodywork of Duralinox. The passenger compartment was faired in except for an opening for the driver, with a raised headrest as part of the bodywork behind his seat. At the front, the leading edges of the fenders projected forward, and during some events were capped by conspicuous forward-facing conical covers. The first X88 was powered by a Panhard twin. The body of the X88 was revised more than once, first to a more traditional sportscar style with exposed headlamps, then to a smooth curving nose with covered lamps. Panhard X89 The original bodywork for the 1953 Le Mans car was similar in appearance to that of the X88 and was also of Duralinox. The X89, however, was powered by the larger Panhard twin. As with the X88, the X89's body was later revised, with at least one car being bodied as a closed berlinette with a smooth curving nose. Panhard's next racing car, the VM5, was designed by engineer Pierre Durand. After the accident at Le Mans in 1955, Panhard withdrew from direct racing involvement, and Monopole became Panhard's officially supported racing team. The cars were transferred to Écurie Monopole and raced as Panhard-Monopoles. Personal life and death On 6 November 1916, after a seven-year engagement, Riffard married. The couple had three sons. In addition to his ability as a mathematician, aerodynamicist, and engineer, Riffard's personal pursuits included music, bel canto, and painting. Riffard died at Versailles in the Yvelines on 9 July 1981 and is buried in Chaville in the Hauts-de-Seine. Memberships Riffard was a member of the Board of l'Aéro-Club de France.

Red and white wines are also made from other grape varieties, such as gamay and aligoté, respectively. Small amounts of rosé and sparkling wines are also produced in the region.

Other smaller appellations near Chablis include Irancy, which produces red wines and Saint-Bris, which produces white wines from Sauvignon blanc. There are 100 Appellations in Burgundy and these are classified into four quality categories. These are Bourgogne, village, premier cru and grand cru. Eighty-five miles southeast of Chablis is the Côte d'Or, where Burgundy's most famous and most expensive wines originate, and where all Grand Cru vineyards of Burgundy (except for chablis grand cru) are situated. The Côte d'Or itself is split into two parts: the Côte de Nuits which starts just south of Dijon and runs till Corgoloin, a few kilometers south of the town of Nuits-Saint-Georges, and the Côte de Beaune which starts at Ladoix and ends at Dezize-les-Maranges. The wine-growing part of this area in the heart of Burgundy is just long, and in most places less than wide. The area is made up of tiny villages surrounded by a combination of flat and sloped vineyards on the eastern side of a hilly region, providing some rain and weather shelter from the prevailing westerly winds. The best wines - from grand cru vineyards - of this region are usually grown from the middle and higher part of the slopes, where the vineyards have the most exposure to sunshine and the best drainage, while the premier cru come from a little less favourably exposed slopes. The relatively ordinary \"village\" wines are produced from the flat territory nearer the villages. The Côte de Nuits contains 24 out of the 25 red grand cru appellations in Burgundy, while all but one of the region's white Grand Cru wines are in the Côte de Beaune (the exception being Musigny blanc). This is explained by the presence of different soils, which favour pinot noir and chardonnay, respectively. Further south is the Côte Chalonnaise, where again a mix of mostly red and white wines are produced, although the appellations found here such as Mercurey, Rully and Givry are less well-known than their counterparts in the Côte d'Or. Below the Côte Chalonnaise is the Mâconnais region, known for producing large quantities of easy-drinking and more affordable white wine. Further south again is the Beaujolais region, famous for fruity red wines made from Gamay grapes. Burgundy's terrain is continental climate characterized by cold winters and hot summers. The weather is unpredictable, with rains, hail, and frost all possible around harvest time. Such a climate results in vintages from Burgundy varying considerably. History Archaeological evidence establishes viticulture in Burgundy as early as the second century AD, although the Celts may have been growing vines in the region previous to the Roman conquest of Gaul in 51 BC. Greek traders, for whom viticulture had been practiced since the late Neolithic period, had founded Massalía in about 600 BC, and traded extensively up the Rhône valley, where the Romans first arrived in the second century BC.

The first known donation of a vineyard to the church was by king Guntram in 587, but the influence of the church became important in Charlemagne's era. The Benedictines, through their Abbey of Cluny founded in 910, became the first truly big Burgundy vineyard owner over the following centuries. Another order which exerted influence was the Cistercians, founded in 1098 and named after Cîteaux, their first monastery, situated in Burgundy. The Cistercians created Burgundy's largest wall-surrounded vineyard, the Clos de Vougeot, in 1336. More importantly, the Cistercians, extensive vineyard owners as they were, were the first to notice that different vineyard plots gave consistently different wines. They therefore laid the earliest foundation for the naming of Burgundy crus and the region's terroir thinking. Since Burgundy is land-locked, very little of its wine left the region in Medieval times, when wine was transported in barrels, meaning that waterways provided the only practical means of long-range transportation. The only part of Burgundy which could reach Paris in a practical way was the area around Auxerre by means of the Yonne. This area includes Chablis, but had much more extensive vineyards until the 19th century. These were the wines referred to as vin de Bourgogne in early texts. The wines from Côte d'Or would then be called (vin de) Beaune. These wines first became famous in the 14th century, during the Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy in Avignon, which was reachable by Saône and Rhône after some overland transport. In the extravagance of the papal court, Beaune was generally seen as the finest wine, and better than anything available in Rome at that time. The status of Burgundy wines continued in the court of the House of Valois, which ruled as Dukes of Burgundy for much of the 14th and 15th centuries. Their ban on the import and export of non-Burgundian wines, effectively shutting out the then popular wines of the Rhone Valley from north European markets, gave a considerable boost to the Burgundy wine industry. It was during this era that the first reliable references to grape varieties in Burgundy were made. Pinot noir was first mentioned in 1370 under the name Noirien, but it was believed to have been cultivated earlier than that, since no other grape variety associated with Medieval Burgundy is believed to have been able to produce red wines of a quality able to impress the papal court. On 6 August 1395, Duke Philip the Bold issued a decree concerned with safeguarding the quality of Burgundy wines. The duke declared the \"vile and disloyal Gamay\"—which was a higher-yielding grape than Pinot noir in the 14th century, as it is today—unfit for human consumption and banned the use of organic fertilizer (manure), which probably increased yields even further to the detriment of quality.

In the 18th century, the quality of roads in France became progressively better, which facilitated commerce in Burgundy wines. The first négociant houses of the region were established in the 1720s and 1730s. In the 18th century, Burgundy and Champagne were rivals for the lucrative Paris market, to which Champagne had earlier access. The two regions overlapped much in wine styles in this era, since Champagne was then primarily a producer of pale red still wines rather than of sparkling wines. A major work on Burgundy wines written by Claude Arnoux in 1728 deals with the famous red wines of Côte de Nuits and the Œil-de-Perdrix pink wines of Volnay, but only briefly mentions white wines. After Burgundy became incorporated in the Kingdom of France, and the power of the church decreased, many vineyards which had been in the church's hands were sold to the bourgeoisie from the 17th century. After the French revolution of 1789, the church's remaining vineyards were broken up and from 1791 sold off. The Napoleonic inheritance laws then resulted in the continued subdivision of the most precious vineyard holdings, so some growers hold only a row or two of vines. This led to the emergence of négociants who aggregate the produce of many growers to produce a single wine. It has also led to a profusion of increasingly smaller, family-owned wineries, exemplified by the dozen-plus Gros family domaines. The awareness of the difference of quality and style of Burgundy wines produced from different vineyards goes back to Medieval times, with certain climats being more highly rated than others. An early author on this aspect of Burgundy wines was Denis Morelot with his La Vigne et le Vin en Côte d'Or from 1831. In 1855, the same year as the famous Bordeaux Wine Official Classification was launched, Dr. Jules Lavalle published an influential book, Histoire et Statistique de la Vigne de Grands Vins de la Côte-d'Or, which included an unofficial classification of the Burgundy vineyards in five classes and which built on Morelot's book. In decreasing order, Lavalle's five classes were hors ligne, tête de cuvée, 1ère cuvée, 2me cuvée and 3me cuvée. Lavalle's classification was formalized in modified form by the Beaune Committee of Agriculture in 1861, and then consisted of three classes. Most of the \"first class\" vineyards of the 1861 classification were made into Grand Cru appellations d'origine contrôlées when the national AOC legislation was implemented in 1936. Burgundy wine has experienced much change over the past 75 years. Economic depression during the 1930s was followed by the devastation caused by World War II. After the War, the vignerons returned home to their unkempt vineyards. The soils and vines had suffered and were sorely in need of nurturing. The growers began to fertilize, bringing their vineyards back to health. Those who could afford it added potassium, a mineral fertilizer that contributes to vigorous growth. By the mid-1950s, the soils were balanced, yields were reasonably low",

        "prompt": "the vineyards produced some of the most stunning wines in the 20th century. For the next 30 years, they followed the advice of renowned viticultural experts, who advised them to keep spraying their vineyards with chemical fertilizers, including potassium. While a certain amount of potassium is natural in the soil and beneficial for healthy growth, too much is harmful because it leads to low acidity levels, which adversely affect the quality of the wine. As the concentration of chemicals in the soil increased, so did the yields. In the past 30 years, yields have risen by two-thirds in the appellations contrôlées vineyards of the Côte d'Or, from 29 hectoliters per hectare (hl/ha) (yearly average from 1951 to 1960) to almost 48 hl/ha (1982–91), according to a study by the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine. With higher yields came wines of less flavor and concentration. Within 30 years, the soils had been significantly depleted of their natural nutrients. The period between 1985 and 1995 was a turning point in Burgundy. During this time, many Burgundian renewed efforts in the vineyards and gradually set a new course in winemaking, producing deeper, more complex wines. Today, the Burgundy wine industry is reaping the rewards of those efforts. Wine characteristics and classification Burgundy is in some ways the most terroir-oriented region in France; immense attention is paid to the area of origin, and in which of the region's 400 types of soil a wine's grapes are grown. As opposed to Bordeaux, where classifications are producer-driven and awarded to individual chateaux, Burgundy classifications are geographically focused. A specific vineyard or region will bear a given classification, regardless of the wine's producer. This focus is reflected on the wine's labels, where appellations are most prominent and producers' names often appear at the bottom in much smaller text. The main levels in the Burgundy classifications, in descending order of quality, are: Grand crus, Premier crus, village appellations, and finally regional appellations: Grand Cru wines are produced by a small number of the best vineyard sites in the Côte d'Or region, as strictly defined by the AOC laws. These Cru wines make up 2% of the production at 35 hl/ha, and are generally produced in a style meant for cellaring, and typically need to be aged a minimum of five to seven years. The best examples can be kept for more than 15 years. Grand Cru wines will only list the name of the vineyard as the appellation - such as Corton or Montrachet - on the wine label, plus the Grand Cru term, but not the village name. Premier Cru wines are produced from specific vineyard sites that are still considered to be of high quality, but not as well regarded as the Grand Cru sites. Premier Cru wines make up 12% of production at 45 hl/ha. These wines often should be aged three to five years, and again the best wines can keep for much longer. Premier Cru wines are labelled with the name of the village of origin, the Premier Cru status, and usually the vineyard",

        "prompt": "for example, \"Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets\". Some Premier Cru wines are produced from several Premier Cru vineyards in the same village, and do not carry the name of an individual vineyard. Village appellation wines are produced from a blend of wines from supposedly lesser vineyard sites within the boundaries of one of 42 villages, or from one individual but unclassified vineyard. Wines from each different village are considered to have their own specific qualities and characteristics, and not all Burgundy communes have a village appellation. Village wines make up 36% of production at 50 hl/ha. These wines can be consumed two to four years after the release date, although again some examples will keep for longer. Village wines will show the village name on the wine label, such as \"Pommard\", and sometimes - if applicable - the name of the single vineyard or climat where it was sourced. Several villages in Burgundy have appended the names of their Grand Cru vineyards to the original village name - hence village names such as \"Puligny-Montrachet\" and \"Aloxe-Corton\". Regional appellation wines are wines which are allowed to be produced over the entire region, or over an area significantly larger than that of an individual village. At the village, Premier Cru and Grand Cru levels, only red and white wines are found, but some of the regional appellations also allow the production of rosé and sparkling wines, as well as wines dominated by grape varieties other than Pinot noir or Chardonnay. These appellations can be divided into three groups: AOC Bourgogne, the standard or \"generic\" appellation for red or white wines made anywhere throughout the region, and represent simpler wines which are still similar to the village. These wines may be produced at 55 hl/ha. These wines are typically intended for immediate consumption, within three years after the vintage date. Subregional (sous-régional) appellations cover a part of Burgundy larger than a village. Examples are Bourgogne Hautes-Côtes de Beaune, Bourgogne Hautes-Côtes de Nuits and Mâcon-Villages. Typically, those communes which do not have a village appellation will have access to at least one subregional appellation. This level is sometimes described as intermediate between AOC Bourgogne and the village level. Wines of specific styles or other grape varieties include white Bourgogne Aligoté (which is primarily made with the Aligoté grape), red Bourgogne Passe-Tout-Grains (which can contain up to two-thirds Gamay) and sparkling Crémant de Bourgogne. Chablis wines are labeled using a similar hierarchy of Grand Cru, Premier Cru, and Village wines, plus Petit Chablis as a level below Village Chablis. Wines from Beaujolais are treated still differently. In general, producers are always allowed to declassify their wine in steps to a lower-ranked AOC if they wish to do so. Thus, a wine from a Grand Cru vineyard may be sold as a Premier Cru from that vineyard's village, a Premier Cru wine may be sold as a Village wine, and so on. This practice will almost invariably mean the declassified wine will have to be sold at a lower price, so this is only practiced when something",

One motive may be to only include vines of a certain age in a Grand Cru wine, to improve its quality and raise its prestige and price, in which case the wine coming from younger vines may be sold as a Premier Cru at a lower price. Overall, such a practice may allow a producer to keep a higher average price for the wine sold. In total, around 150 separate AOCs are used in Burgundy, including those of Chablis and Beaujolais. While an impressive number, it does not include the several hundred named vineyards (lieux-dits) at the Village and Premier Cru level, which may be displayed on the label, since at these levels, only one set of appellation rules is available per village. The total number of vineyard-differentiated AOCs that may be displayed is well in excess of 500. Production In 2003, the Burgundy vineyards (including Chablis but excluding Beaujolais) covered a total of . Côte d'Or as a whole, including Hautes Côtes de Beaune and Hautes Côtes de Nuits, covered , of which the heartland of Côte de Nuits covered and Côte de Beaune . In 2000, Burgundy had a total of 3,200 wine domaines (compared to 50 in the early 19th century), of which 520 were in the department of Yonne, 1,100 in Côte-d'Or and 1,570 in Saône-et-Loir. Generally, the small growers sell their grapes to larger producers, merchants called négociants, who blend and bottle the wine. The roughly 115 négociants who produce the majority of the wine only control around 8% of the area. Individual growers have around 67% of the area, but produce and market only around 25% of the wine. Some small wineries produce only 100–200 cases/year, while many producers make a few thousand cases/year. Grower/producer-made wines can be identified by the terms Mis en bouteille au domaine, Mis au domaine, or Mis en bouteille à la propriété. The largest producer is Maison Louis Latour in Beaune with 350,000 cases/year. The négociants may use the term Mis en bouteille dans nos caves (bottled in our cellars), but are not entitled to use the estate-bottled designation of the grower/producers. Most négociants tend to use the term Mis en bouteille par... (bottled by...). Grape varieties Of the white grapes, Chardonnay is the most common. Another grape found in the region, Aligoté, tends to produce cheaper wines which are higher in acidity. Aligoté from Burgundy is the wine traditionally used for the Kir drink, where it is mixed with black currant liqueur. Sauvignon blanc is also grown in the Saint Bris appellation. Chablis, Mâcon wines and the Côte d'Or whites are mostly produced from 100% Chardonnay grapes. Of the red grapes, the majority of production in the Côte d'Or is focused on the Pinot noir grape, while the Gamay grape is grown in Beaujolais. In the Côte de Nuits region, 90% of the production is red grapes. Rules for the red Burgundy appellations, from regional to Grand Cru level, generally allow up to 15% of the white grape varieties Chardonnay, Pinot blanc",

Reputation and appreciation Burgundy is home to some of the most expensive wines in the world, including those of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, Domaine Leroy, Henri Jayer, Domaine Leflaive and Domaine Armand Rousseau. Its renown goes back many centuries; in 1522 Erasmus wrote: \"O happy Burgundy which merits being called the mother of men since she furnishes from her mammaries such a good milk\" This was echoed by Shakespeare, who refers in King Lear to \"the vines of France and milk of Burgundy\". British wine critic Jancis Robinson has stated that \"price is an extremely unreliable guide\" and \"what a wine sells for often has more to do with advertising hype and marketing decisions than the quality contained in the bottle.\" While Grand Crus often command steep prices, village level wines from top producers can be found at lower price points. In 2010, the Burgundy region experienced a notable increase in internet coverage thanks to official efforts like the online broadcast of the famous Hospices de Beaune, as well as the efforts of independent wine aficionados, such as Bourgogne Live. Some burgundies are also increasingly valued as investment wines. Fans of Burgundy wine have been organizing events celebrating its virtues for decades.

At the time, most Christian nations heavily incorporated scripture into their laws, and as such it was illegal for any person to charge interest on a loan of money. To get around this, a set of three separate contracts were presented to someone seeking a loan: an investment, a sale of profit and an insurance contract. Each of these contracts were permissible under canon law, but together replicated the effect of an interest-bearing loan. The way this procedure worked was as follows: The lender would invest a sum equal to the amount of financing required by the borrower for one year. The lender would then purchase insurance for the investment from the borrower, and finally sell to the borrower the right to any profit made over a pre-arranged percentage of the investment. This system replicated the effects of a loan with any interest rate agreed between the two, yet provided protection to the lender against default, while the borrower remained under the protection of the law when it came to collection of the money by threats or force (loan sharking). The Church proved utterly unable to legislate against the contractum trinius, and the idea quickly spread to merchants and bankers across Christendom. It was accepted by writers such as Gabriel Biel; it helped in part to improve public perception of the practice of usury by moneylenders, and ultimately the doctrine was rewritten by the School of Salamanca, and the ban on interest-bearing loans overturned in many Protestant countries, starting with England by Henry VIII Some Muslims are of the view that the present practice of Islamic banking relies on devices similar to the contractum trinius as a means of working around a ban of riba (usury) in religious scripture.

The other eight are: ATLAS, ALICE, CMS, LHCb, LHCf, MoEDAL, FASER and SND@LHC. It shares an interaction point with CMS. The detector aims at measurement of total cross section, elastic scattering, and diffraction processes. The primary instrument of the detector is referred to as a Roman pot. In December 2020, the D0 and TOTEM Collaborations made public the odderon discovery based on a purely data driven approach in a CERN and Fermilab approved preprint that was later published in Physical Review Letters. In this experimental observation, the TOTEM proton-proton data in the region of the diffractive minimum and maximum was extrapolated from 13, 8, 7 and 2.76 TeV to 1.96 TeV and compared this to D0 data at 1.96 TeV in the same t-range giving an odderon significance of 3.4 σ. When combined with TOTEM experimental data at 13 TeV at small scattering angles providing an odderon significance of 3.4 - 4.6 σ, the combination resulted in an odderon significance of at least 52 σ.

John was the eldest surviving son of Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke, and a great-grandson of the firm’s founder, Francis Baring. Career at Barings At the age of twenty, John left Cambridge to join the family firm. After a few years learning the basics in the counting house, he was sent on an extensive tour of North and South America to learn first-hand about Barings' international interests and meet the people he would later be dealing with. He became a partner in January 1890, less than a year before Barings nearly collapsed in the Panic of 1890. He was not implicated in that affair, so was allowed to continue as partner and played an increasingly important role in the affairs of the reorganized firm. By the outbreak of the First World War, Barings’ prestige had been fully restored under his leadership. During the War, Revelstoke was closely concerned with raising finance for the Imperial Russian government. Outside Appointments Revelstoke held numerous appointments outside the firm.

Vesikko was ordered by a Dutch engineering company Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (a German front company) in 1930 as a commercial submarine prototype, being the prototype for the German Type II submarines. Purchased by the Finnish before World War II, she saw service in the Winter War and Continuation War, sinking the Soviet merchant ship Vyborg as her only victory. After the cease-fire with the Allies in 1944, Vesikko was retired. Finland was banned from operating submarines after the war and she was kept in storage until she was turned into a museum ship. Vesikko was one of five submarines to serve in the Finnish Navy. The other four were the three larger boats , , and the small . The word \"vesikko\" is the Finnish name for the European mink. Development and design Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS), was a German front company in the Netherlands, established to secretly design a new German submarine fleet. According to the terms of the Versailles Peace Treaty after World War I, Germany was banned from building and operating submarines among other \"offensive\" weaponry. This resulted in moving the armaments' research to foreign countries. For example, German tanks and aircraft were tested and developed in the Soviet Union. Therefore, unlike the other submarines in the Finnish Navy, Vesikko was not part of the Naval Act. Instead, it was part of the secret rebuilding of the German Navy, the Reichsmarine. The objective of Germans was to design a modern submarine type to be used during general mobilization; technology and standards were to be new and not based on World War I designs. For this",

        "prompt": "two prototypes were built, E1 in Spain and CV 707 in Finland. The latter was later chosen as a first submarine type for the new fleet. Construction of both of these experimental submarines was funded by the Reichsmarine. Commander Karl Bartenbach, who had retired from active service in the Reichsmarine, worked as secret liaison officer in Finland. His official title was Naval Expert of the Finnish Defence Forces, and it was under his leadership that the 496-ton and the 100-ton were built in Finland. Both submarine types were designed by IvS. For the German Navy, his mission was to oversee the developing and construction of a 200–250 ton submarine, which would still equal the combat effectiveness of the Vetehinen class. The whole task was named The Lilliput Project. The official decision allowing Vesikko to be constructed in Finland was made in 1930 after several meetings with the Finnish Government. Since The Liliput Project broke the terms of the Versailles Peace Treaty, there was no mention of Germany in the agreement, and it was decided that the new submarine could only be sold to nations belonging to the League of Nations. The would-be buyers also had to have the rights to own such a weapon. The Finnish Government gained primary rights to purchase the submarine. The construction of CV 707 begun in 1931 at the Crichton-Vulcan dock in Turku. At the time of its construction, CV 707 was one of the most advanced submarine designs. For example, the maximum depth was over twice that of earlier German submarines, and its hull could be built completely by electric welding. By eliminating rivets there was increased resistance to water pressure, decreased oil leakages, and the construction process was faster. Germans tested CV 707 in the Archipelago of Turku during 1933–34. Vesikko was a prototype for the German Type II submarines. Six Type IIA submarines (U-1 to U-6) which were almost identical to Vesikko were built in the Deutsche Werke dock in Kiel, and after these, 44 Type IIB, IIC, and IID submarines were built before and during World War II. Service history According to the agreement between the Finnish Ministry of Defence and the Crichton-Vulcan company, Finland had the primary purchase option until 1937, and the Finnish Government took over the submarine during August 1934. After the Finnish Parliament had approved the acquisition in 1936, the submarine joined the Finnish Navy under the name of Vesikko. Winter War Vesikko was deployed with Vesihiisi to the Hanko region on 30 November 1939 as several Soviet surface combatants were headed towards the area. However the submarine failed to arrive in time to intercept the and its escorts. Vesikko was able to get close enough to see the cruiser but was unable to reach firing position as it had to evade shellfire. When on 17 December and on two following days the Soviets sent the battleship Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya to bombard Finnish positions at Koivisto, the Finnish Navy decided to send out Vesikko to hunt for it.

Continuation War In summer 1941 all Finnish submarines were once again readied for combat operations and they sailed to the staging area in the Gulf of Finland. Vesikkos base of operations was to be Vahterpää island near the town of Loviisa. When the Continuation War started on 25 June, all submarines were ordered to patrol the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland. On 3 July 1941 Vesikko sank a Soviet merchant ship named Vyborg east of Gogland island. The attack was made from the target; first one torpedo was launched at 13:25 which hit the stern of the target. The target stopped but did not appear to be sinking so Vesikko fired another torpedo which failed to explode. Very soon after the strike, three Soviet patrol boats started to chase Vesikko and tried to destroy it with depth charges and assist the damaged ship but failed to accomplish either task. Vyborg sank on 3 July at 14:15. Soviet historiography later downplayed the sinking of Vyborg, insisting that several submarines and German naval bombers had assaulted the ship simultaneously, and that over twenty torpedoes had been launched against it. During fall 1941 Vesikko operated from Helsinki and made three patrols to the coast of Estonia. In 1942, equipped with depth charge rack, she acted as an escort to convoys in the Sea of Åland, and hunted suspected hostile submarines near Helsinki. In the beginning of June 1944, Vesikko escorted the convoys which were evacuating people from the Karelian Isthmus. Due to the armistice between Finland and the Soviet Union, Vesikko was ordered to return to port on 19 September 1944. Vesikko sailed the last time as a combat vessel of the Finnish Navy in December 1944. During wartime, several officers were commanders of the submarine: Ltn. Kauko Pekkanen (1939), Capt. Ltn. Olavi Aittola (1940 and 1941), Capt. Ltn. Antti Leino (1942), Capt. Ltn. Pentti Airaksinen (1942), Capt. Ltn. Eero Pakkala (1943), Capt. Ltn. Olavi Syrjänen (1943), and Capt. Ltn. Lauri Parma (1944). Museum ship In January 1945, the Allies' Commission responsible for monitoring the observance of the Peace treaty ordered the Finnish submarines to be disarmed, and in 1947 according to the terms of the Paris Peace Treaty, the Finnish Defence Forces were forbidden to have any submarines. The Finnish submarines Vetehinen, Vesihiisi, Iku-Turso, and Saukko were sold to Belgium to be scrapped in 1953. Vesikko was spared because the Finnish Defence Forces hoped that Finland could in future gain permission to use submarines again, and Vesikko was then meant to be used for training purposes. Vesikko was stored at the Valmet Oy dock in Katajanokka district in Helsinki. In 1959, the Finnish Navy decided to sell Vesikko because Finland had not managed to obtain the right to use submarines again, and because Valmet Oy complained that the old submarine hampered the work in the dock.

D'Oyly Carte Opera Company On joining the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1896 at the Savoy Theatre Childerstone sang in the chorus for the 1896 revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas The Mikado and Trial by Jury and probably also in the original production of His Majesty (1897). He played Archibald Jones the Income Tax Collector in 252 performances of Old Sarah at the Savoy Theatre in mid-1897 and when it was a companion piece to the revival of The Yeomen of the Guard (August–November 1897) in which production he also sang in the chorus and later played First Yeoman. Also at the Savoy he was in the chorus for The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein (December 1897 to March 1898) and a revival of The Gondoliers (March to May 1898), in which he played the non-singing role of Annibale; Old Sarah was also a companion piece to these. In 1898, still at the Savoy, he was A Lad of the Town in Sullivan's The Beauty Stone and reprised the role of Annibale in The Gondoliers. In September that year he appeared in a revival of The Sorcerer and played the non-singing part of the Associate in Trial by Jury, while December 1898 saw him share the role of the Defendant in Trial with four other tenors. From January to May 1899 Childerstone sang the Chamberlain in The Lucky Star and from June to December 1899 again played the Defendant in Trial by Jury when that work had a further revival with H.M.S. Pinafore, occasionally filling in as Ralph Rackstraw. He created the minor role of the Physician-in-Chief in Sullivan's last completed opera, The Rose of Persia (1899–1900) at the Savoy Theatre, where he also Henry in Hamilton Clarke's The Outpost, which played there July to November 1900 as a companion piece to a revival of The Pirates of Penzance; it also played from November to December 1900 as a companion piece to Patience. When The Outpost closed Childerstone returned to the chorus for The Emerald Isle (1901) until he took over from Powis Pinder as Private Perry later in that production. In 1901 he married Mary Muir née McGee (1871–1944). Their son was Clifford Louis Muir Childerstone (1903–1978). Continuing in the chorus at the Savoy, Childerstone appeared in Ib and Little Christina (November 1901) and Iolanthe (December 1901 to March 1902) and in April 1902 he was a Lord in Merrie England. After in a 14-week tour the company returned with that piece to the Savoy until January 1903. In December 1902 he appeared in a benefit performance of Trial by Jury for William Rignold at the Lyric Theatre. His next named role was as the sailor Will Weatherly in A Princess of Kensington produced by William Greet at the Savoy until May 1903 and then on tour until later that year, when the company disbanded.

The fourth and current Missouri Constitution was adopted in 1945. It provides for three branches of government: legislative (the Missouri General Assembly), executive (the Governor of Missouri), and judicial (the Supreme Court of Missouri). It also sets up local governments in the form of counties and cities. History The first constitution was written in 1820 in only 38 days, and was adopted on July 19, 1820. One of the results of the Missouri Compromise, Missouri was initially admitted to the Union as a slave state, and the constitution specifically excluded \"free negroes and mulattoes\" from the state. This \"exclusion clause\" initially forestalled the US Congress admitting Missouri to the union, but was chosen to be interpreted in a deliberately vague manner as a \"second\" compromise. This constitution took effect the day Missouri joined the union as the twenty-fourth state, August 10, 1821. During the American Civil War, the Missouri Constitutional Convention (1861-63) was elected to decide on secession. They chose against secession, and did not produce a new constitution. Instead, they operated as the de facto pro-Union government of Missouri when Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson and other politicians that supported the Confederacy fled from Jefferson City. They provided elections to a new constitutional convention, which was elected in November of 1864 and met in January of 1865, and passed a second Missouri state constitution that abolished slavery, ratified on June 6, 1865. This second constitution was known as the \"Draconian Constitution\" due to its loyalty oath provisions, which were struck down by the US Supreme Court in Cummings v. Missouri (1867). This constitution remained in effect for ten years. The fourth constitutional convention was held in 1875, which drafted the state's third constitution. The convention met from May 5 to August 2, and the resulting constitution provided for, among other things, separate schools for African-American children. In the early 1900s, the Constitution of 1875 was amended to allow constitutional amendment by the initiative process. The state's fifth constitutional convention was held from 1922 to 1923. This convention proposed a slate of twenty-one amendments instead of a new constitution. The delegates assembled in Jefferson City from May 15, 1922 to November 6, 1923. The ballot form permitted a separate vote on each amendment with a simple majority allowing adoption. Seven of the 21 amendments were adopted. The election details are available in the 1925-1926 Official Manual of Missouri. In the early 20th century, Missouri was dominated by corrupt political \"bosses\", such as Tom Pendergast of Kansas City. In reaction to this, reformers used the initiative to call for a sixth constitutional convention, and the initiative was passed by the voters in 1942. The voters ratified the new constitution in 1945. The Constitution of 1945 remains Missouri's current constitution. Since 1945, there have been at least 119 amendments made to the Constitution. In recent years, some of these have been both controversial and high-profile, such as legalizing commercial gambling in",

Located in the eastern half of the Helsinki conurbation, some north of the capital's downtown district, it is the administrative and commercial hub of Vantaa, although Myyrmäki is a rival commercial hub within the municipality. Tikkurila's most popular attraction is the science center Heureka. Tikkurila railway station is the busiest in Vantaa and third-busiest in Finland. As the nearest mainline station to Helsinki Airport (located from Tikkurila), it is served by all the high-speed Pendolino trains on the Helsinki to Tampere and Lahti routes as well as other long-distance services. Some of the other communities surrounding Tikkurila are Jokiniemi, Simonkylä, Ruskeasanta, Hiekkaharju, and Puistola in the Helsinki municipality. History Tikkurila has been a marketplace since the 16th century, from which it has also received its name. Tikkuri is an old Finnish term referring to an amount of ten, used in fur trading at the time. The road between Turku and Vyborg, King's Road, ran through the area, though the area remained a sparsely populated piece of the Helsinki Parish until the late 1800s. In 1862, the railway between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna was constructed, and one of its seven stations was built in Tikkurila, on its intersection with King's Road. The Swedish architect Carl Albert Edelfelt designed a Renaissance Revival styled station building, which (as of the 1970s) has since been adapted into the Vantaa City Museum. The railway brought industry into the area, including an expeller pressing plant, which currently operates in the area as the paint manufacturer Tikkurila Oyj. The railway also induced population growth. In 1946, Tikkurila became the administrative hub of Vantaa (then known as Helsingin maalaiskunta, ), after Malmi was transferred to Helsinki. Post-war population growth led to Tikkurila becoming the most populated area in Vantaa, though the Myyrmäki district and major region have both since become more populated than the Tikkurila equivalents. In 1960, a neofuturistic swimming hall was completed in Tikkurila. Culture Finland's largest science center, Heureka, is located in Tikkurila. Opened in 1989, it is a nonprofit organization devoted to popularizing scientific information and to developing the methods used to teach science and scientific concepts. The hemispheric-shaped planetarium primarily presents films dealing with astronomy; until 2007, the theatre was called the Verne Theatre, and it ran super films and multimedia programmes made with special slide projectors that took advantage of the entire 500 m2 surface of the hemispheric screen. Vantaa City Museum is a museum located in the old station building of Tikkurila railway station. It is operated by the city with free admission, and conducts diverse research and mapping work in co-operation with other parties, for example in connection with the archeology, cultural history and traditions of the urban area. It is used to host exhibitions publishing its own research and studies as well as other works related to the city's history. Tikkurila also",

In 1908 her last owners renamed her Maitai. She was wrecked on a reef in the Cook Islands in 1916. The ship should not be confused with an earlier steamship called Maitai, which was wrecked on Richards Rock near the Mercury Islands in 1889. Building Swan, Hunter built Miowera at Wallsend on the River Tyne, launching her on 25 July 1892 and completing her that October. She was a sister ship for , which Swan, Hunter launched in May 1892 and completed in July. Service James Huddart ordered Warrimoo and Miowera for his New Zealand and Australian Steam Ship Company to run a Trans-Tasman service between New Zealand and Australia. However, in 1893 Huddart created the Canadian-Australian Steam Ship Company to operate a liner service between Australia and Vancouver, British Columbia, and he transferred Warrimoo and Miowera to this new service. In 1897 the New Zealand Shipping Company bought both Warrimoo and Miowera. In 1908 the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand, commonly called simply the \"Union Company\", bought Miowera and renamed her Maitai. The Union Company ran Maitai between Wellington and San Francisco.

Maitais crew set about retrieving an anchor that the ship had lost in the harbour on a previous visit. Later it was noticed that Maitai was drifting, and about 2120 hrs she struck a reef. Her first officer ran to her bridge and rang \"full astern\" on her engine order telegraph, but Maitai was stuck fast amidships and could not move herself. Maitai was carrying 43 passengers and 900 tons of cargo, including more than 1,400 bags of mail bound for New Zealand. Much of the mail was from troops serving overseas. Maitai was stuck on South Reef. There was a heavy swell that rolled the ship, and became stronger in the course of the evening. In difficult and worsening conditions her crew disembarked her remaining passengers and put them ashore and unloaded all her mail. Her engine room and stokehold flooded, forcing her stokers to abandon the stokehold at about 0100 hrs on 26 December. On 26 December local labour was enlisted to remove Maitais stores and fittings and as much as possible of her cargo. Because her engine room was flooded she could not raise steam to work her winches, so everything had to be lifted manually. About 400 tons of her cargo was saved. By 1500 hrs on 26 December there was of water in her number three hold. The Union Company chartered the steamship Cholita to come to her aid from Tahiti, and the New Zealand Shipping Company diverted its liner to help. Rotorua reached Rarotonga on 31 December, embarked Maitais passengers and loaded her mails. Rotorua already had a full complement of passengers, so Maitais passengers had to provide their own bedding and travel as deck passengers. Rotorua had been bound for Wellington, but with Maitais mails and passengers she diverted to Auckland, where she arrived on the evening of 8 January. Wreck Maitais wreck lies in shallow water. Above water the only surviving part of the ship is the cylinder block of her triple-expansion steam engine. What remains of her below the surface has become part of the reef Diving on the wreck is possible only in very favourable conditions.

In 2015, it was reprised and presented at the Pasadena Playhouse as part of a month-long celebration of the 20th anniversary of the case. Background On August 2, 1995 in El Monte, California, 72 Thai nationals were discovered working and living in an apartment complex ringed with barbed wire and spiked fences, sewing clothes for major retailers and manufacturers. Some of the captives had been held for as long as seven years by the leader of a human trafficking ring, “Auntie Suni.” The story made national and international headlines as the first case of modern-day slavery since the abolishment of slavery in the United States.<ref>Martorell, Chanchanit and Beatrice \"Tippe\" Morlan (2011).

He developed the play over the years through workshops and readings. Singapore Repertory Theatre staged Fabric'' in a world premiere in 2000. This was followed by a production by Nomad Theater in Surrey, England the next year. Company of Angels produced it in 2010, in association with Thai Community Development Center, in commemoration of the 15th anniversary of the Thai garment workers slavery case. Synopsis The play interweaves two stories. The first follows a group of Thai nationals who are lured by a human trafficking ring into coming to America to work in a garment factory, masterminded by a Thai national (aka Auntie Suni) who was assisted by her sons and daughters in-law. Once here, these workers found themselves confined in an apartment building that had been converted into an underground sewing shop. Under the thumb of Auntie Suni, the men and women were forced to work long hours (from 7 a.m. to midnight) with no weekend breaks or holidays to pay off their debts to the traffickers. The other thread in the narrative involves a law enforcement investigation. A garment worker escapes from the premise. She speaks about her predicament to an Immigration Officer, who is familiar with Thai culture, having worked in Thailand for many years and is married to a Thai woman. Through investigations by both the Immigration and Naturalization Service; and the State Labor Commission, a raid is planned on the apartment complex. Auntie Suni, the ring leader, and her family members are arrested and brought to justice The workers are freed and allowed to live in the United States.

Extant species The Kabomani tapir was at one point recognized as another living member of the genus, but is now considered to be nested within T. terrestris. Evolution Tapirus first appeared in the Late Miocene in North America, with Tapirus webbi perhaps the oldest known fossil species. Tapirus spread into South America and Eurasia during the Pliocene. It has been suggested that the tapirs that inhabited North America during the Late Pleistocene may be derived from a South American species that remigrated north, perhaps Tapirus cristatellus.

The song peaked at number one in Australia, staying there for two weeks in March 1975. The single was greatly helped along by the band's appearance on the then-new ABC pop music TV show Countdown. At the Australian 1975 King of Pop Awards the song won Australian Record of the Year. Along with \"Women in Uniform\", \"Horror Movie\" is widely recognised as one of the Skyhooks' signature tracks. The song itself, written by bass guitarist Greg Macainsh, is about how the world has taken a turn for the worse with all of the chaos in society, to the point where watching the nightly TV news is like watching a horror movie. This song remains popular as a Halloween song in both the United States and Canada. It appears on the compilation album Elvira Presents Haunted Hits. Video Australian music television show Countdown made an in-house video featuring the band at Luna Park, Melbourne as well as miming the song in front of an audience. It was broadcast on the first day of colour television in Australia. In Peter Wilmoth's Glad all over : the Countdown years, it was said, \"Shirl here gives the distinct impression that he would rather be surfing. There’s also the (not so) small matter of the ludicrously large outstretched hand painted on the crotch of his tight satin jumpsuit); the gladiator’s hat worn by drummer Freddie Strauks; the black lipstick, white make-up and long black hair on Bob Starkie; and Red Symons who is a remarkable combination of ingénue, geisha and the devil himself.\" Biographer Jeff Apter agreed, \"it was the scene-stealing - or should that be crotch-grabbing - satin sleeveless number he wore that really caught the eye of young Australia. Shirl had perfected the art of TV performance, as he bugged his eyes and stared down the barrel of the camera, pouting and preening.\" Reception In January 2018, as part of Triple M's \"Ozzest 100\", the 'most Australian' songs of all time, \"Horror Movie\" was ranked number 47.

The route generally starts in Greenland, then follows the Atlantic coast of Canada, then south down the Atlantic Coast of the United States to the tropical areas of South America and the Caribbean. Every year, migratory birds travel up and down this route following food sources, heading to breeding grounds, or traveling to overwintering sites. This route is used by birds typically because no mountains block most of this path, though birds cross the Appalachian Mountains to join the flyway. Good sources of water, food, and cover exist over its entire length. The warm climates found in the southern portion of the region are home to many northern birds in winter, while in summer the region is home to many bird species from South America. Land located within the Atlantic Flyway is the most densely populated land out of the four major flyways crossing the United States. Notable locations Along the Atlantic Flyway, there are many key sites that migratory birds use to gather to breed, feed, or rest for certain periods. Some species may remain in these rest stops for the entire season, but most continue to move on. Notable locations include: Canada Great Plain of the Koukdjuak, Nunavut Shepody Bay West, New Brunswick United States Acadia National Park, Maine. The park preserves about half of Mount Desert Island, many adjacent smaller islands, and part of the Schoodic Peninsula on the coast of Maine. A total of 215 bird species, including migratory birds, are present at some time during the year. An additional 116 species are possibly present but unconfirmed, making a total of 331 potential species. Assateague Island National Seashore, Maryland and Virginia.

The name of the cultivar comes from the apples' dark red or purplish skin, though despite the name, the fruit does not have a black hue. History The apple was first grown in orchards around the parish of Kingston St Mary in Somerset, whose inhabitants referred to it simply as the \"black apple\". Kingston Black is capable of making a distinctive single-variety cider, and its value in cidermaking meant that by the early 19th century it became more well known. By 1950 the Long Ashton Research Station referred to it as \"more widely grown than any other cider apple\" in the West of England. Despite this popularity, one former Long Ashton staff member wrote that many thought the variety's fame as a vintage quality apple was \"somewhat exaggerated\", and Hogg quoted a Taunton nurseryman as stating that Kingston Black \"of itself makes a thin cider, but a few only communicate a high colour to other ciders\". In later years use of Kingston Black declined in commercial orchards due to the variety's tendency to poor cropping and its susceptibility to canker and apple scab. Characteristics The Kingston Black is classed as a \"bittersharp\" in the standard classification of cider apples, being high in both tannin and acid. The tree is strongly biennial in fruiting, and can be prone to common apple diseases Its fruit is small, round in shape, yellow skinned with red streaks on the shade side of the fruit or dark red with dark purple streaks on the sunward side, and patches of grey russetting.

The area is now in the province of Savona, Italy. To protect itself from possible attacks and invasions by Savona and Marquisate of Finale, Noli allied in 1202 with the Republic of Genoa in a sort of protectorate, in fact, documents of the time show that the relationship was equal and not one of submission. The alliance allowed the Republic of Noli to have such growing importance that in 1239, a diocese was established there by Pope Gregory IX. History Noli was founded in 1192. After 10 years of existence, the small maritime republic allied itself with the larger and more powerful neighbouring Genoese Republic, which gave Noli the status of a Genoese protectorate until its dissolution in 1797. Throughout its history Noli was ruled by a Podestà. It survived for 605 years before it was annexed by Napoleon in 1797. Economy Despite",

Military Noli's efficient shipyard allowed them to become somewhat of a naval power, despite its small size. The alliance with Genoa afforded it much protection, especially as Genoa used Noli's port to shelter their ships. It is known that during a conflict with Savona, Noli sacked the town of Spotorno, which was owned by them, in 1227. Foreign relations In 1202, Noli was threatened by the County of Savona. In response, Noli formed a confederation with the powerful Republic of Genoa. Noli kept this alliance until they were dissolved in 1797. Flag The flag of Noli was first created in the 13th century, with a white cross and a red background, the exact opposite of Genoa's flag. Many of the merchant ships of Noli chose to fly under the Genoese flag, as it commanded much more respect Religion In 1239, the Pope appointed a bishop to Noli.

The tunnel was located in Somerset County, Pennsylvania near the 106.3 milemarker of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. While the South Pennsylvania Railroad never came to fruition and is known in history as \"Vanderbilt's Folly\", the Quemahoning Tunnel has the distinction of being the only tunnel of the nine tunnels constructed on the South Pennsylvania alignment that was actually used by railroads, as it was used by the Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad from 1909 to 1916. When the newly formed Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission purchased the South Pennsylvania Railroad alignment in 1937, the Turnpike considered using the Quemahoning Tunnel, but instead bypassed it. The Laurel Hill Tunnel, which was also constructed by the railroad but used by the Pennsylvania Turnpike until its own bypassing in 1964, is located six miles to the west. The Negro Mountain Tunnel, also bypassed by the Turnpike during the original construction, is located ten miles to the east. As of 2019, it was planned to be daylighted as part of the expansion of the turnpike to 6 lanes.

The company is based outside Dallas, Texas in the United States and has operations globally. History The company was founded in 1895, in Marshalltown, Iowa, by Dave Lennox, the owner of a machine repair business for railroads. Inventors Ezra William Smith and Ernest Bryant brought their idea for a riveted steel coal-fired furnace to his machine shop to build parts for a prototype. In lieu of payment, Lennox accepted their patent, obtaining rights to the idea. He founded the Lennox Furnace Co. improving the design that led to numerous advancements in heating, cooling and climate control solutions. The company was sold in 1904 to DW Norris who managed the company until his death in 1949, following which ownership devolved to his descendants who continued to hold a prominent position in the company in the following decades. From 1964-65, Lennox dabbled in the lawn and garden industry by building a small crawler tractor and mower called the Lennox Kitty Track 600. It featured a Briggs & Stratton engine and a 32\" mower deck. In 1971 the small, nonprofitable (low pressure) gas cylinder business of Lennox Industries was sold to Worthington Industries, marking its first diversification step. In 1973, Lennox purchased the commercial refrigeration products firm Heatcraft, including the Larkin, Bohn, Chandler, and Climate Control brands. In 2010, the Kysor/Warren brand was added under the Heatcraft umbrella Air conditioning Lennox has three different series of air conditioners, Elite, Dave Lennox Signature Collection and Merit series.

He served as a minister in the government of Albert Hawke. Brady was born in Perth to Mary (née Fleming) and Thomas Brady. His family moved to Geraldton in 1911, where he attended Stella Maris College. After leaving school, he worked on the railways for a period and then in a flour mill in Dongara, where he eventually became acting manager. Brady moved back to Perth in 1929 and settled in Midland, where he became involved in the union movement. A secretary of the local trades hall, he was elected to the Midland Junction Municipal Council in 1934, and would serve until 1940. Brady first stood for parliament at a 1942 Legislative Council by-election for Metropolitan-Suburban Province, but was defeated by the Nationalist Party's candidate, Frank Gibson. William Johnson, the sitting member for the seat of Guildford-Midland, died in office in January 1948. Brady entered parliament at the resulting by-election. He was appointed deputy chairman of committees in the Legislative Assembly after the 1953 state election, and elevated to the ministry after the 1956 election, as Minister for Native Welfare and Minister for Police. He served in the ministry until the Hawke government's defeat at the 1959 election. At the 1962 election, Guildford-Midland was abolished, and Brady successfully transferred to the new seat of Swan. He retired from parliament at the 1974 election, and died in Perth in May 1993, aged 89 He had married Winifred Anna Kilgren in 1929, with whom he had three children.

As a lecturer in the 1970s he experimented with Process Theology. He holds many honorary doctorates and a Lambeth DD (2012) and is an honorary fellow of Trinity College (Melbourne), Emmanuel College (Cambridge) and St John's College (Cambridge). Ordination of women Carnley was consecrated a bishop on 26 May 1981 at St George's Cathedral, Perth and installed there as Archbishop of Perth and Metropolitan of Western Australia in the same service. In the 1980s he supported the ordination of women and, on 7 March 1992, he ordained the first women priests in the Anglican Church of Australia at St George's Cathedral, Perth. His sermon on the occasion took as its reference an autobiographical piece by Charlotte Perkins Gilman entitled The Yellow Wallpaper. Carnley used Gilman's account of the self-destruction consequent on a \"benignly prescribed, submissive, middle-class role\" demanded of women in the 19th century to consider the \"implications of the philosophy that women should \"stay in their place, maintaining silence, concealing problems and repressing creativity\". The yellow wallpaper of the title is what the imprisoned protagonist in Gilman's story peels off the walls as she goes mad. Carnley used it as a metaphor for the situation of the women who had been waiting to be allowed to become priests, saying: \"Today, we are peeling away the sickly yellow, faded, silverfish-ridden wallpaper with which the church has surrounded itself and imprisoned women for centuries past in its benign and perhaps well-meaning determination to confine them by role.\" Ecumenism From 2004 he served as co-chair of the Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC II) seeking greater unity between the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion. He served as distinguished visiting professor in systematic theology at the General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church in New York City from 2010 to 2013. In 2001, amid questions about the possibility of the church celebrating same-sex marriages, Carnley suggested that the church might be able to bless gay \"friendships\". Later, Carnley acknowledged that the consecration of American Bishop Gene Robinson created controversy in the church, but predicted that the church would not be irreparably split over the issue. Controversy In The structure of resurrection belief Carnley outlines several different ways Christians frame their belief in the resurrection of Christ and the way the resurrection frames their faith. He explores notions of the resurrection as an historical event, as an eschatological event and as a non-event. He also explores the role of memory, presence and faith in believing in the resurrection. When Carnley became the Australian primate, his views caused controversy with some, especially in the conservative Diocese of Sydney where Archbishop Harry Goodhew accused Carnley of breaching church doctrine and betraying the church's belief in the significance of the resurrection and of Jesus Christ himself.",

Carnley says he believes in the uniqueness of Christ: \"I think Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life, but that doesn't mean that other religions don't have any truth at all.\" He also says he has an Easter (or resurrection) faith in the real presence of the living Jesus: \"The Christian story, which pre-eminently transmits and celebrates the memory of Jesus and God’s revelatory deed in and through his life and death, should lead us beyond itself to a living encounter with the real presence of all that it celebrates and rehearses: him, whom by story we recall, we actually know as the living Spirit of the fellowship of faith.\" He also asserted that the resurrection is \"the miracle of the Christian tradition\".

The exact date for the battle varies from 555 AD to 561 AD. 560 AD is regarded as the most likely by modern scholars. The battle is notable for being possibly one of the earliest conflicts over copyright in the world. Traditional accounts Traditional accounts ascribe different reasons for this battle. The most famous is the story about the copying of a book belonging to Saint Finnian by Columcille - an account that first appears in the Life written by Manus O'Donnell, written nearly a thousand years after the alleged events supposedly took place, and therefore a highly unreliable source.

        "prompt": "560, the Irish abbot and missionary Saint Columba became involved in a quarrel with Saint Finnian of Movilla Abbey over a psalter (traditionally said to be the Cathach of St. Columba). Columba copied the manuscript at the scriptorium under Saint Finnian, intending to keep the copy. Saint Finnian disputed his right to keep the copy. Thus, this dispute was about the ownership of the copy (whether it belonged to Saint Columba because he copied it or whether it belonged to Saint Finnian because he owned the original). King Diarmait mac Cerbaill gave the judgement, \"To every cow belongs her calf, therefore to every book belongs its copy.\" Columba disagreed with King Diarmait's ruling against him and reportedly instigated a successful rebellion of the Uí Néill clan against the King. The battle was claimed to have caused around 3,000 casualties. Another traditional reason given for the battle concerns the violation of sanctuary. The Annals Of Tighernach for the year 559, record the death of Curnan son of Aed, son of Eochaid Tirmcharna by Diarmait mac Cerbaill, while Curnan was 'ar comairce Coluim chilli - under Colum Cille's protection'. This Curnan was the son of Aed, the king of Connacht. That Diarmait had violated the sanctuary of the termonn at the Columban monastery of Kells is given as the reason for the battle. Either way, as a monk who had taken up arms, Colmcille faced judgement for his deeds. It said that the judgement resulted in Columba leaving his homeland for Scotland, where he founded Iona Abbey in 563. The sentence stipulated he was to win as many souls to Christianity as had been lost in the battle. The Chronicles of Iona state that \"In the second year after the battle of Cul-drebene, the forty-second year of his age, Columba sailed away from Ireland to Britain wishing to be a pilgrim for Christ.\" This last note rather contradicts the notion that Columba had been sent away as a punishment: he was rather fulfilling a monastic vocation. Modern investigations However, these later versions have been disputed by modern scholarship on several grounds, particularly as early mentions of the battle do not refer to the book incident It may have been a dynastic battle between the Cinel Cairbre and Diarmait Mac cerbaill who had wrested the kingship at Tara from them after the death of Tuathal Maelgarb.

(Nijmegen Eendracht Combinatie), Sparta Rotterdam, and FC Utrecht. Since ending his playing career, he has worked as an assistant coach and skills trainer. Playing career Kronshorst was born in Delft. He began playing football at Delfia-Hollandia Combinatie (DHC) in his hometown of Delft. At the age of sixteen, he made his debut for the DHC team that played in the Eerste Divisie (\"first division\", the second-highest tier of Dutch football). After DHC merged with Xerxes in 1967, Kronshorst made his first appearance in the top-tier Eredivisie. After one year, he moved to Holland Sport, with whom he played in the Eredivisie from 1968 until 1971. At the age of twenty-five, Kronshorst left Holland Sport for N.E.C., where he played two seasons with the \"Einstein of Football\" Wiel Coerver, of whom he has said: \"Until then, during training we jumped over fences, played tag and leap-frog. Coerver focused on technique. He fell out with almost everyone. He introduced strength-training and made it clear that football was more than a game. When I came into contact with the training methods of Wiel Coerver, I had the overwhelming feeling that I would have become a much better footballer if I'd started this training as a youth.\" In the winter of 1974, following Coerver's departure to Feyenoord, Kronshorst was loaned to Sparta.",

History The Mexican American Legislative Caucus (MALC) was founded in 1973 in the Texas House of Representatives by a small group of lawmakers of Mexican American heritage for the purpose of strengthening their numbers and better representing a united Latino constituency across the state. MALC is the oldest and largest Latino legislative caucus in the United States. In the 1990s, recognizing the growth of the Hispanic population in Texas and anticipating a new ethnic majority, MALC opened membership eligibility to House members of any race or ethnicity who represent majority-Latino constituencies. Mission Latinos today represent Texas’ fastest growing political and economic sector. To meet the needs of this rapidly growing population, MALC serves as an information clearinghouse to Caucus members and non-members alike. By researching the implications of policy on Texas' Hispanic communities and by voting together, the Mexican American Legislative Caucus ensures that the interests of all Texans are represented. MALC’s educational outreach initiatives, conducted between bi-annual sessions of the Texas Legislature, strive to raise the level of Latino engagement in Texas government and politics. Membership As of 2013, MALC had a membership of 40 Democratic House members from all parts of the state, and is the second-largest caucus in Texas. Members are on all but 3 House Committees in the Texas House of Representatives. MALC members vote as a bloc on consequential matters for Latino constituents. 2013 Officers Chairman Trey Martinez Fischer, San Antonio Vice-Chairman Eddie Rodriguez, Austin Secretary Armando \"Mando\" Martinez, Weslaco Treasurer Mary Gonzalez, El Paso Legal Counsel Ana Hernandez Luna, Houston Roberto Alonzo, Dallas Carol Alvarado, Houston Rafael M Anchía, Dallas Lon Burnam, Fort Worth Terry Canales, Edinburg Garnet Coleman, Houston Philip Cortez, San Antonio Dawnna Dukes, Austin Joe Farias, San Antonio Jessica Farrar, Houston Larry Gonzales, Round Rock John Garza, San Antonio Larry Gonzales, Round Rock Naomi Gonzalez, El Paso Bobby Guerra, Hidalgo Ryan Guillen, Rio Grande City Roland Gutierrez, San Antonio Abel Herrero, Robstown Tracy O.

United States, 219 U.S. 346 (1911), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court delineated the authority of United States federal courts to hear certain kinds of cases under the Case or Controversy Clause of the United States Constitution. Facts In this case, Congress passed a statute permitting certain Native Americans to bring suits against the United States to determine the constitutionality of a law allocating tribal lands, and providing that Counsel for both sides were to be paid from the United States Treasury. Several cases were brought pursuant to this statute, including suits brought by David Muskrat and J. Henry Dick opposing the partition of Indian lands, and by another pair, William Brown and Levi B. Gritts, opposing a prohibition against the sale of certain Indian lands. Result The United States Supreme Court refused to allow the case to be heard, maintaining that, though the United States was named as a defendant, the case in question was not an actual controversy: rather, the statute was merely devised to test the constitutionality of a certain type of legislation, and the Court's ruling would be nothing more than an advisory opinion; therefore, it dismissed the suit for failing to present a \"case or controversy\", as required by Article III of the United States Constitution. Later developments Although this decision remains as valid case law, its effective precedent has been diminished by the Supreme Court's approval of the declaratory judgment act, which permits a party to seek a declaration of rights against another party, even where no affirmative relief (e.g. damages or an injunction) is being sought. In a declaratory judgment action, if under the facts as proved, there is some possibility of a future need for relief as among the parties, a declaratory judgment may be entered.

History Original restaurant Charles W. Chessar was a New York City restaurateur who was nicknamed \"Beefsteak Charlie\" by Howard Williams, a sports editor for the New York Morning Telegraph. Chessar opened his first restaurant around 1910, and moved to 50th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue in 1914, which he operated until 1934. The restaurant was filled with horse racing photographs and frequented by sports enthusiasts, and the specialty of the house was a steak sandwich. A fire in March 1933 destroyed many of the racing pictures, though some still remain in the family of the subsequent owner, William Soshnick. After Chessar left, his namesake restaurant was owned and operated by William Soshnick, who migrated to the U.S. along with his family to avoid anti-semitic oppression in Congress Poland. Soshnick was one of five immigrant brothers that eventually owned and operated",

William Soshnick sold Beefsteak Charlie's upon his retirement in the late 1960s and moved to Tucson, Arizona. During Soshnick's ownership the restaurant became a popular hangout for jazz musicians in the 1950s and 1960s. Chain expansion The Beefsteak Charlie's restaurant chain was started in early 1976 by restaurateur Larry Ellman, whose Steak & Brew chain (part of the Longchamps organization) had filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in fall 1975: Steak & Brew, Inc., was renamed Beefsteak Charlies, Inc., many Steak & Brew locations were converted into Beefsteak Charlie's. As the chain first filed for a trademark on the \"Beefsteak Charlie's\" name in March 1976, and no prior trademark existed, it appears there was no direct connection to the namesake restaurant which inspired the chain. Beefsteak Charlie's marketing concept emphasized an all-you-can-eat salad bar, as well as unlimited beer, wine, or sangria. Early 1980s advertising featured an actor in early 20th century dress playing the role of Beefsteak Charlie, later joined by his nephew \"Beefsteak Chuck.\" Two of the chain's famous indulgent slogans were \"I'll feed you like there's no tomorrow\" and \"You're gonna get spoiled.\" By 1984, the chain had over 60 locations, primarily on the East Coast. Corporate owner Beefsteak Charlies, Inc., changed its name in 1985 to Lifestyle Restaurants, Inc. In August 1987, the chain was acquired by Bombay Palace Restaurants, via a merger with Lifestyle Restaurants for a reported $8.4 million in stock. At the time of the 1987 merger, the chain had 48 locations, but had closed 20 locations and lost $20 million since 1984. When Bombay filed for bankruptcy two years later, the chain had only 35 outlets. In 1992, the chain was advertising its two remaining locations in Manhattan—at 51st Street and Broadway (originally the famous Lindy's location), and at 45th Street and Eighth Avenue. In 2000, franchise restaurant operator Riese Organization converted its 45th Street location into Joe Franklin's Memory Lane Restaurant. A Manhattan location on Eighth Avenue at the Howard Johnson's Plaza hotel closed shortly after September 11, 2001. Several locations remained until the early 2000s. At least as of March 2003, one \"Beefsteak Charlie's\" was advertised as being open in Elmsford, New York, though it is unclear whether the restaurant had any connection to the prior chain, as the chain's trademarks had expired, and a new registration was filed in 2001. In 2009, a new Beefsteak Charlie's opened in the Westfield Sunrise Mall in Nassau County, New York, which closed shortly after its opening. In popular culture The name may possibly have originated from a story by O. Henry. The closing song on Todd Rundgren's 1976 album Faithful, \"Boogies (Hamburger Hell)\", opens with a reference to Beefsteak Charlie's, which former Utopia drummer Kevin Ellman was currently operating along with his family. The restaurant was parodied in a 1980 Saturday Night Live skit as \"Pre-Chew Charlie's\", a steakhouse where the waiters come to your table and chew your food for you.

Early life Moy was born in the Liberty of the Rolls (now part of Westminster) in London around 1823. In the 1851 census of Islington he is listed as living with his wife Henrietta and six-month-old daughter and is described as a 28-year-old law stationers clerk. In 1881 Moy was living in Camberwell and was described as a 58-year-old civil engineer. In 1901 he was still living in Camberwell but was now described as a 78-year-old mechanical engineer and patentee; his wife also with him, but she died a few months after the census.

Moy was one of the earliest members of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain (later the Royal Aeronautical Society), founded in 1866, and presented a number of papers at its meetings, including one in 1869 describing the soaring flight of albatrosses in a wind. His best-known work, the Aerial Steamer was constructed in 1874 and tested at the Crystal Palace in South London in July 1875, with limited success: the aviation historian Charles Gibbs-Smith credits the machine with a brief flight, lifting off the ground by 6 in (15 cm) However, according to Octave Chanute's contemporary and detailed account, the aircraft never came close to flying because it was unable to reach the speed necessary for takeoff. The society described it as \"one of the most determined attempts at solving the problem [of powered flight] which has yet taken place.\" Shortly after the first test the machine was damaged in a storm: Moy rebuilt it with substantial modifications, but after brief tests the project was abandoned owing to lack of money. He was also involved in a dispute over patent rights with Mr. Shill, the engineer who had worked with him on the development of the engine. In 1879 he demonstrated the Military Kite to a meeting of the Aeronautical Society. This was a rubber-powered model, capable of taking off under its own power. Around 1901 Moy was experimenting with an ornithopter mounted on an elevated track at Farnborough, Kent In March 1904 Moy gave a lecture to the Aeronautical Society on mechanical flight. After his lecture the president announced: Moy died in 1910. The Aerial Steamer The Aerial Steamer, sometimes called the Moy-Shill Aerial Steamer, was an unmanned tandem wing aircraft driven by a 3 hp (2.25 kW) steam engine using methylated spirits as fuel. This drove a pair of six-bladed propellers placed between the two bamboo and stretched linen wings, of which the rear had a span of 14 ft (4.27 m) and an area of 64 ft2 (5.9 m2): the front wing was slightly smaller, with an area of 50 ft2 (4.6 m2). A third smaller surface was mounted at the rear of the aircraft: this was adjustable for the purpose of altering the trim. It was 14 ft (4.27 m) long and weighed about 216 lb, (98 kg) of which the engine accounted for 80 lb (36 kg), and ran on three wheels. Moy's first set of propellers consisted of a number of individual wooden blades attached to the six spokes of the assembly, their pitch becoming finer the further they were from the hub: this arrangement was replaced by stretched fabric blades before the flight test. The propellers were fitted with a mechanism designed to alter the pitch of the blades as they rotated, so that the blades moving downwards were at a coarser pitch to provide a lifting force. It was tested in tether around an ornamental fountain at the Crystal Palace in South London in June 1875 on a circular rolled gravel track of nearly 300",

A wooden deck was then laid over the gravel, and a second attempt made: Moy later told Octave Chanute that it did not reach a speed of above 12 mph (19 km/h) and did not lift off: Moy had calculated that a speed of around 35 mph (56 km/h) would be necessary. However it is credited with being the first steam-powered aircraft to have left the ground under its own power by the historian Charles Gibbs-Smith. Shortly afterwards the Aerial Steamer was severely damaged by in a gale. Moy rebuilt it, with the propellers enlarged to 12 ft (3.66 m)and now rotating about a vertical axis, in effect transforming the machine into a helicopter. In this configuration it now weighed . He tested it under cover, and it was found that by suspending it and counterbalancing of its weight it would lift off, the \"aerial wheels\" (as Octave Chanute calls them) providing lift. The Military Kite In 1879 Moy demonstrated his Military Kite to a meeting of the Royal Aeronautical Society. This was a small model aircraft propelled by a pair of rubber-driven propellers which rotated in opposite directions. This had two lifting surfaces like the Aerial Steamer, but was more like a modern aircraft in that there was a principal lifting surface mounted in front of a second lifting surface of half the span and a quarter of the area. The bow-shaped surfaces were made of cambric, had dihedral and an adjustable angle of incidence and were fixed to on a central pine box-girder, mounted on wheels. Unlike Alphonse Pénaud's Planophore of 1871, which had to be hand-launched, the Military Kite could take off under its own power.

Gilbert was born in Toronto and grew up in a poor working-class family which he helped support during the Great Depression by selling newspapers at the corner of Yonge and Bloor for two cents each and by gathering coal that had fallen off horse-drawn coal wagons in order to help heat his family's home. The home was eventually lost when the bank foreclosed on its mortgage. He was the youngest of five children, his parents were poor Irish Protestants who had immigrated to Canada. He left school early to support his family by working in a box factory until marrying his wife, Nora, and going to university. As an adult, Gilbert became a lawyer and worked briefly for a large firm. He left it, feeling they charged clients too much, and set up his own private practice. Once a week he went to the Salvation Army to operate a clinic where he gave free legal counsel to the poor. He vowed that every dollar he earned over $5,000 a year he would give away.

Jack Layton said of Gilbert : \"The work that John did in Parliament was exemplary. He, alongside Tommy Douglas and Ed Broadbent, believed that fundamental elements of healthy and prosperous living should not come and go with the precocity of economic times; rather, he believed that the purpose of having a government was to defend the rights and the dignity of people from every social station, and to ensure that nobody had to go without the basic necessities of life.\" \"He was one of the members of Parliament that I most admired in my life,\" said former NDP leader Ed Broadbent who served in the House of Commons with Gilbert for several years, describing him as a gentle and kind individual adding \"there wasn't a tinge of self-righteousness about him,\" and that the MP \"was always good in caucus. He knew the national issues and he made his views known.\" In 1969, Gilbert criticized the Liberal government of the day accusing it of lacking the commitment to build affordable housing and instead spending money on an inquiry of the issue to discover what was already known. He retired from Parliament in 1978 to accept an appointment as a judge on the Ontario District Court. He asked a young Bob Rae to run as the NDP candidate to succeed him in Broadview Rae accepted and was elected in a 1978 by-election.

After graduating in 1986, he relocated to South Africa, where his father was working as an economic counsellor for the Republic of China. Kan was working in a cutlery manufacturing facility when in 1987 he attended the first personal computer (PC) exhibition hosted by the Taiwanese government in Johannesburg. It was here that Kan met the then managing director of the Taiwanese company Mustek Corporation, Owen Chen, who was interested in setting up a warehouse in South Africa. Kan made a partnership proposal with Chen and visited Mustek Corporation in Taiwan to receive training. Career Kan set up Mustek in South Africa in 1987, importing and distributing components and assembling PCs for other brands, and then becoming manufacturer of the Mecer brand of computers. Considered a pioneer in the tech space in South Africa, he led the development of the country’s first PC assembly plant. To get the business started, he borrowed $50,000 from both Chen and his father. That was the only capital investment the company would ever need. Kan attributed the company’s early success “with being at the right place at the right time”, as the demand for PCs began to grow in the 1980s, and import tariffs gave Mustek a competitive advantage in establishing its dominance in the South African market. In 1995, Rectron was established as part of the Mustek Group to focus on the distribution of PC components. Mustek also comprises Mecer Inter-Ed, a controlling shareholding in Palladium, shareholdings in Sizwe Africa IT Group and Khauleza IT Solutions, and a substantial shareholding in Yangtze Optics Africa Cable.

The band has been noted for their use of insect costumes when performing live.

The Locust was formed in 1994 by Bobby Bray, Justin Pearson, Dylan Scharf, Dave Warshaw, and Dave Astor. After a number of personnel changes, they arrived at their ultimate four-piece lineup in 2001, consisting of Bray, Pearson, Joey Karam and Gabe Serbian. The Locust was initially a powerviolence project whose first release was a split with genre pioneers Man Is the Bastard. Later releases incorporated synthesizers and became increasingly theatrical. The band regularly played shows in all-ages punk clubs in Los Angeles and San Diego, usually donning insect costumes. In September 1998, The Locust released their first full-length album, The Locust, through Gold Standard Laboratories. On June 24, 2003, The Locust released their second full-length album, Plague Soundscapes, through ANTI-. On March 20, 2007, The Locust released their third and ultimately final full-length album, New Erections, through ANTI-. After lengthy touring following the release of New Erections, The Locust went on hiatus. On May 18, 2010, The Locust released an archive recording of their Peel Session recorded 9 years prior in 2001, simply named The Peel Sessions, released through Radio Surgery. This 16-track recording was the first time Gabe Serbian had started playing drums for The Locust, finalizing the lineup of Bobby Bray, Joey Karam, Justin Pearson and Gabe Serbian that has remained ever since. On July 31, 2012, The Locust released a compilation album, The Gold Standard Labs, through ANTI-. The album contains all the band's material released on the Gold Standard Laboratories label which is all their material from 1997 to 2002. In 2013, The Locust returned from hiatus and in 2019 they were added to the Desert Daze 2019 festival line up. Bassist Justin Pearson confirmed that the band would add more shows after this, with new material and new costumes. On May 1, 2022, the band announced the death of drummer Gabe Serbian that had occurred the day before. The band have since announced on their Instagram account that they can no longer be active in the wake of Serbian's death, and that no further albums or live performances will occur under the Locust name. The final piece recorded by the group is a remix of the Danny Elfman solo track \"Cruel Compensation\" which appears on the remix album Bigger. Messier. Style and influences The Locust were known for their unique mix of grindcore speed and aggression, complexity, and new wave weirdness. The band's musical genre is typically described as grindcore, hardcore punk, powerviolence, mathcore and noise rock. About the band's aesthetic, vocalist/bassist Justin Pearson has said, \"I wanted to change the way people perceive music, or maybe just destroy it in general.\" The Locust's music is complex, dynamic and fast-paced, often featuring abrupt and inconsistent time-signature changes. These erratic elements are, according to vocalist/guitarist Bobby Bray, \"a reflection of perhaps how our brains have to function in order to be able to do anything in the Western societies we live in.\" Stylus described the band's",

Their drummer is named Gabe Serbian, and their music hits me now like D.R.I. hit me in the early '80s.\" The Locust have had a unique stage presence: costumed in skin-tight, full body nylon suits (which the band refer to as uniforms). The last 5 different suits were designed and made by Ben Warwas. Unlike most bands, which normally have the drums set up behind the other members, the four members of The Locust usually all positioned in a line at the front of the stage. The group recommended that in order to get the full impact of the music, one should see them live. The Locust boycotted Clear Channel Communications and refused to play in any Clear Channel-owned venues. This boycott affected a 2005 tour with Fantômas, as well as another tour with Yeah Yeah Yeahs. They also had a policy of only playing all-ages shows. Equipment Karam plays an assortment of analog synthesizers, including various Moog models and a patch-panel modular synth. Bray plays a Gibson SG, and Pearson plays a see-through body Dan Armstrong bass made by Ampeg. Serbian plays Ludwig drums with Paiste cymbals. Controversies Pearson appeared as a \"rock-star slut\" in an episode of The Jerry Springer Show. It culminated in a French kiss with Scott Beiben, owner of the record label Bloodlink. Pearson wore a T-shirt for The Locust during the appearance. Pearson later stated \"I was beat up during a commercial break by one of the 'security guards' pretty bad for blowing snot on the carpet.\" The Locust have been accused of encouraging the use of drugs because the band sold vanity mirrors as merchandise: fans and others mistook the mirrors as being intended for use as a surface from which one could snort cocaine. In an interview with Scene Point Blank Justin Pearson was asked \"You guys make Locust compacts, modeled after cocaine mirrors. Do you feel it's irresponsible to sell these to your younger fans?\" Pearson responded \"I'm not sure what you are talking about. I have never done cocaine and we never modeled any sort of merchandising product or idea after cocaine mirrors. However we did have vanity mirrors. In case you were not aware, they could be used for a variety of things such as make-up application, picking food out of your teeth, popping zits, fixing your bangs, etc. About the second part of your question, we are not responsible for anyone besides ourselves.

The club fields a team in both the Men's and Women's NBL1 South. The Chargers play their home games at the Derwent Entertainment Centre and Kingborough Sports Centre. Club history Early years In 1981, the Hobart Hornets entered the South Eastern Basketball League (SEBL) for the league's inaugural season. After two seasons in the SEBL, the team withdrew from the league due to the introduction of the Hobart Devils in the National Basketball League in 1983. The Hornets re-entered the SEBL, now known as the SEABL, in 1990. Between 1990 and 1996, Hobart had seven straight seasons of missing the playoffs under coaches Denis Hyland (1990–91; 1993–95), Danny Adamson (1992), and Ross Park (1996). Success of the Chargers The Chargers name was born in 1997 after the demise of the Hobart Devils. The Chargers immediately saw success as they won back-to-back CBA South Conference championships in 1997 and 1998. In 2000 and 2002, they not only won their third and fourth South Conference titles, but were successful in claiming National Championship honours in both years. During this period, a Hobart Chargers women's team had an unsuccessful five-year run between 1998 and 2002, as they failed to make a playoff berth in",

In 2008, Dan Krebs took over as coach of the Chargers and guided them to their fifth South Conference title. They went on to win the overall SEABL championship after defeating East Conference champions, the Knox Raiders, in a contest that earned the winning team a semi-finals place in the Australian Club Championships. In the ACC semi-finals, the Chargers defeated the Melbourne Tigers 128–126 to move on to the grand final. There they were defeated 103–99 by the Rockhampton Rockets to finish as national runners-up. Despite his successful season with the Chargers, Krebs was replaced as coach in 2009 with former NBL player Anthony Stewart. In 2010, the Lady Chargers re-entered the league. In 2014, they made their way through to their first ever conference final. New era of Hobart basketball In September 2016, former Tasmanian Labor premier, David Bartlett, was appointed president of the Chargers. Bartlett's immediate aim was to have the club be \"NBL ready\" in three years. He also set his sights on having both the men and women play in three finals series and win at least one championship over those three years, and acquire a new home venue for the club – for more than a decade, the Chargers had played at the Hobart Netball and Sports Centre, but were forced to train at New Town High and Warrane Stadium because the centre was not available during the week. Although the men's team bounced back from two years in the playoff wilderness to reach the South Conference final in 2016, the club still had numerous issues off the court at the time of Bartlett's appointment, including being $120,000 in debt. Financial problems almost resulted in the men's team being booted from the 2016 SEABL playoffs, while questions remained about the financial security of the women's program. In November 2016, David Bartlett boldly declared his long-term vision of averaging 3,000 fans for SEABL matches after securing a deal which saw basketball in Hobart return to its spiritual home. After nearly two months of negotiations with the Glenorchy City Council – and having landed a third major sponsor in Schweppes – the Chargers announced that they would play home SEABL contests at the Derwent Entertainment Centre from 2017 onwards. Bartlett's next goal was to update the club to a new look by refreshing their brand within the southern basketball community. With the help of Chargers members, supporters and basketball fans, a new logo and playing strip was introduced for the 2017 season. In October 2017, Bartlett declared a Tasmanian NBL side could be competitive with a yearly budget of $5 million. In August 2018, the men's team won the SEABL championship. Around that time, plans to get the Chargers into the NBL morphed into an overarching Tasmanian bid for a proposed new club to be called Southern Huskies. The SEABL was disbanded following the 2018 season and was replaced by NBL1, of which the Chargers chose not to compete in. On 30 September",

He played for the San Francisco 49ers from 1948 to 1960, the Baltimore Colts from 1961 to 1962, and returned to the 49ers in 1963 for his final year in football. He was exceptionally fast, a trait uncommon for a fullback and one which earned him the nickname, \"the Jet\". The first African-American to be named the NFL Most Valuable Player, he became one of American football's first black stars. After playing a season of football for Compton Junior College, Perry joined the U.S. Navy. While playing football in the military, he was spotted by the 49ers, who signed him into the AAFC. He spent the next 13 seasons playing for San Francisco, where he was featured in the \"Million Dollar Backfield\", made three straight Pro Bowl appearances, and in 1954 was named the NFL MVP by United Press International (UPI). He was the first player in the NFL to rush for 1,000 yards in consecutive seasons, doing so in 1953 and 1954. Perry retired in 1963 as the league's all-time leader in rushing yards, and in 1969 he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. His jersey number 34 was retired by the 49ers in 1971. Early life Fletcher Joseph Perry was born in Stephens, Arkansas, and grew up in Los Angeles, California, after his family moved there during the Great Depression. He was a four-sport star at David Starr Jordan High School in Los Angeles. Perry grew up admiring several African-American athletes at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), including Jackie Robinson, who played football and baseball and ran track for the university. After being rejected by UCLA, Perry played football at Compton Junior College in 1944, and scored 22 touchdowns that season. He was then recruited by UCLA, but declined, and enlisted in the Navy during World War II. He played football in the military for Naval Air Station Alameda. In an East vs. West college all-star game in January 1948, Perry scored on a four-yard run in the first quarter for the West, which also featured Bobby Layne of Texas and Jake Leicht of Oregon. Professional career Standing tall and weighing , Perry was small for a typical fullback, even during his era. Also unlike typical fullbacks, Perry's forte was not to run with power, as he was a straight-ahead runner who combined power and speed with deceptive elusiveness. His role was primarily as a ball carrier rather than a blocker, and he had a knack for finding holes in opposing defensive lines. \"If you saw a hole, you take it,\" Perry described his running style to The Sacramento Bee. \"If you didn't, you kept moving until you did.

San Francisco 49ers 1948–1952: AAFC and first Pro Bowl While playing for Alameda, Perry was scouted by the NFL's Los Angeles Rams, who offered him a $9,500 salary. He turned down the offer and instead signed with the San Francisco 49ers of the AAFC for $4,500. His decision was based on his trust in 49ers owner Tony Morabito, who Perry described as like a father. He was the team's first African-American player. It was during his first practices with the 49ers that he earned his nickname, when quarterback Frankie Albert exclaimed, \"You're like a jet, Joe,\" after Perry had shot out of his stance so quickly that Albert could not hand him the ball in time. Albert's successor at quarterback, Y. A. Tittle, echoed his sentiments. \"He was the fastest player off the ball in the history of the world,\" Tittle told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"You'd take the ball from center and turn, and he was already gone through the hole.\" Tittle became one of Perry's closest friends. Black players were a novelty in pro football when Perry entered the league, and he was faced with racial abuse and discrimination on and off the field. \"I can't remember a season when I didn't hear a racial slur,\" he said. \"Someone would say, 'Nigger, don't come through here again', and I'd say, 'I'm coming through again, and you better bring your family.'\" When he was invited to play in the 1949 AAFC All-Star game in Houston, he and other black players on the all-star team were not allowed to stay in the same hotel as white players. There was initial uncertainty over whether or not black players would be allowed to participate in the game at all. Perry's 49ers teammates, however, were more accepting of him, and provided him strong support from the outset. With the 49ers in the AAFC, Perry led the league in rushing touchdowns in both 1948 in 1949, and also in rushing yards in 1949. He had the first and only kick return touchdown of his career in 1948 when he returned a kickoff 87 yards against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Following the season, Perry was invited to play in the 1949 AAFC All-Star game against the league champion Cleveland Browns. The AAFC folded soon after and the 49ers were absorbed into the NFL in 1950. Perry finished fifth among league rushing leaders in both 1950 and 1951. The 49ers acquired halfback Hugh McElhenny in the 1952 Draft, who joined Perry in the backfield to form a prolific rushing duo.

His ten rushing touchdowns and 13 total touchdowns in 1953 were both the most in the NFL that year. Perry, McElhenny, and Tittle comprised the offensive backfield of that year's Pro Bowl. The Associated Press (AP), United Press (UP), and New York Daily News each named Perry their first-team All-Pro fullback. Morabito awarded Perry an extra five dollars for every yard he gained in 1953, for a total bonus of $5,090. With the 49ers' acquisition of halfback John Henry Johnson in 1954, Perry now had a reliable blocker to run behind. The backfield of Perry, Johnson, Tittle, and McElhenny—which became known as the \"Million Dollar Backfield\"—shattered the 49ers team record for rushing yards in a season. Despite having to split more carries between him and his teammates, Perry again led the NFL in rushing yards. He gained almost 400 yards more than his nearest competitor, his backfield mate Johnson.

His streak was snapped by McElhenny in 1956.

He was amazing on the screen pass, like McElhenny. And Joe clawed and scratched for every yard.\" A thigh ligament injury caused him to miss several games in 1962 which, along with an injury to halfback Lenny Moore, severely hampered the Colts' running game. He was traded back to San Francisco in 1963, where he played a diminished role in his final nine games before retiring at age 36. Legacy and honors Perry's durability allowed him to play in three decades, from the 1940s to the 1960s, for 16 seasons.

Other ventures and later life In addition to his football career, Perry also hosted a popular sports and music radio program, \"Both Sides Of The Record\", sponsored by Burgermeister Beer (\"Burgie\"), on R&B-formatted KWBR (1310 AM; later known as KDIA) beginning in 1954. The program was arranged by Franklin Mieuli, a sports entrepreneur who worked in marketing for Burgie, in addition to being a part-owner of the 49ers and producer of the team's radio and television broadcasts.

The outpost is situated east of the Israeli West Bank barrier, 4.7 km kilometers from the Green line on what is officially known as Hilltop 850. Established in October 2001, Avigayil has a population of roughly 50, consisting of 30 families as of 2014, up from 17 registered in 2010, and is within the municipal jurisdiction of the Har Hebron Regional Council. The international community considers all Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, which the Israeli government disputes.

Agriculture and livestock raising are the main sources of livelihood for most of the Sudanese population. It was estimated that, as of 2011, 80 percent of the labor force were employed in that sector, including 84 percent of the women and 64 percent of the men. Agricultural products regularly accounted for about 80 to 95 percent of exports until the oil industry came on line. Total sector activities contributed an estimated 35.5 percent of GDP in 2006, a decline from the years prior to the development of the oil industry. Crop cultivation was divided between a market-oriented sector comprising mechanized, large-scale irrigated and rain-fed farming (mainly in central Sudan) and small-scale farming following traditional practices carried out in parts of the country where rainfall or other water sources were sufficient for cultivation. Large investments occurred over time in mechanized, irrigated, and rain-fed agriculture, which together accounted for roughly two-thirds of Sudan’s cultivated land. The early emphasis on growing cotton on irrigated land decreased. Peanuts, wheat, and sugarcane are major crops, and considerable quantities of sesame also are grown. Rain-fed mechanized fanning continues to produce mostly sorghum, but the cultivation of sesame has increased, and short-fiber cotton is also grown. Production in both subsectors increased domestic supplies and export potential. This gain appeared, however, to have been achieved mainly by expanding the cultivated area rather than by increasing productivity. Most subsistence cultivators produced sorghum as their staple crop, although in the northerly rain-fed cultivated areas millet was the principal staple. Subsistence farmers also grew peanuts and sesame. Following food shortages in 2001, there was an attempt to increase land area for the production",

The increase in food production, however, was at the expense of the production of export crops, although export crops increased in 2004 and the export of sesame and cotton continued to increase through 2008. History Land use Before the secession of South Sudan, the Ministry of Agriculture estimated that Sudan had 84 million hectares of potentially arable land. The area under permanent crops was estimated at more than 19 million hectares in 2010, about 23 percent of potential arable land. Substantial variations existed in land classified as actually used or potentially usable for livestock grazing. The Ministry of Agriculture and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) classified about 24 million hectares as pastureland. In 1975, however, a United Nations interagency mission to Sudan had estimated the total potential grazing land at between 120 million and 150 million hectares. Total forest area declined from 71.2 million hectares in 1990 to 61.6 million hectares in 2000. The use of some woodland areas for grazing, the dearth of rainfall during the 1980s, and the ecological damage from mechanized farming caused steady deforestation. In 2011 Sudan still had a substantial amount of land suitable for future cropping. The 1975 UN mission believed that two-thirds of the potential area for livestock grazing, however, was already in use, and that proportion had probably increased over time with the rising numbers of livestock. In addition to land suitable for cultivation and livestock grazing, Sudan also had about 76 million to 86 million hectares of desert. An area of about 2.9 million hectares was covered by swamps and inland water, and additional land was occupied by urban settlements and other man-made features. Land tenure The right to own property, to bequeath it to heirs, and to inherit it was established by the 1973 constitution (then known as the Permanent Constitution), although that right was suspended in 1985. Sudan has long had a system of land registration through which an individual, an enterprise, or the government can establish title to a piece of land. Such registration was extensive in Northern Sudan, especially in the then-states of Al-Khartoum, Al-Awsat, and Ash Shamali. Before 1970 all other land (unregistered) belonged to the state, which held ownership in trust for the people, who had customary rights to it. The Unregistered Land Act of 1970 declared that all waste, forest, and unregistered lands were government land. Private land was limited to that registered before 1970 under a 1929 land ordinance and was limited to agricultural land along the Nile and a few areas along other water courses. Such land amounted to only about 1 percent of all land. Individuals could, however, lease land from the government and gain usufruct rights. The government owned most of the land used by the modern agricultural sector and leased it to tenants (for example, in the Gezira Scheme) or to private entrepreneurs, such as most operators of large-scale mechanized rain-fed farming. The lease rights were for specified periods of time; for example, leases rights for the large mechanized farms were typically for 25 years. There",

The communal land used for pasture and for subsistence cultivation was owned by the government but under the control of the community or local leader, who allocated it to households of the village or ethnic group for their exclusive cultivation. The rights to such land might be passed on to heirs, but ordinarily the land could not be sold or otherwise disposed of, nor used as collateral. The right was also retained to land left fallow, although in Bahr al-Ghazal, Upper Nile, and Equatoria there were communities where another individual could claim such land by clearing it. Among the transhumant communities of the North, the rights to cultivated land were much the same, but the dominant position of livestock in community activities introduced certain other communal rights that included common rights to grazing land, the right-of-way to water and grazing land, the right to grass on agricultural land unless the occupier cut and stacked it, and the right to crop residues unless similarly treated. In the western savannas, private ownership of stands of hashab (gum arabic) trees could be registered, an exception to the usual government ownership of the forests, but dead wood for domestic fuel and the underlying grass were common property. Water, a matter of greatest importance to stock raisers, was open to all if free standing, but wells and the associated drinking troughs were private property and retained by the digger season after season. In Northern Sudan, especially in the western region where increasing population and animal numbers placed pressure on the land, violations of customary laws and conflicts between ethnic groups over rights to pasturage and water increased during the 1990s and early 2000s. These were major factors behind the warfare that began in Western Sudan in early 2003. Crops Sesame seed became Sudan’s prime agricultural export commodity in the mid-1990s, and it was also used domestically to produce oil for cooking. The yield varied in recent years, with a production of 416,000 tonnes in 1996. It was 350,000 tonnes in 2008 and about 248,000 tonnes in 2010 because of a decline in productivity. As of 2018, Sudan produced 981,000 tons of sesame seed, making it the world's largest producer. Sesame exports earned US$141 million in 1996, some 23 percent of export revenues. They decreased to US$93 million in 2007, constituting 1.2 percent of export earnings, but increased to US$167.3 million in 2010. Gum arabic is the most important forest product of Sudan, which accounts for 80 percent of the world’s supply. It is collected from acacia trees in Darfur and Kordofan and used widely in industry for products ranging from mucilage (for postage stamps), to foam stabilizers, to excipient in medicines and dietetic foods. The Gum Arabic Company markets the product, with restraints placed on the right of any private company to independently export unprocessed gum arabic. The justification given for regulating its sale is that its quality would deteriorate and export quantities and prices would decline if sales were deregulated.

It declined to 16,000 tonnes by 2000 but surpassed 30,000 tonnes in 2010. Export earnings were US$40 million in 2003 and about US$24 million in 2010. Peanuts are one of Sudan’s major cash crops. Peanuts grow on rain-fed land in the far west and also under irrigation. They are both a domestic source of food and oil and a major export. Production had been decreasing as a result of low producer prices, low world market prices, disease, and drought, but conditions turned around in the early 2000s. Production was 1.2 million tonnes in 2003, although revenues remained low. Production dropped around 2008-2010, but Sudan produced 2.8 million tons of peanuts as of 2018, making Sudan the fourth largest producer in the world. Exports provided US$741,000 in 2007 and US$200,000 in 2010. Sorghum is the Sudanese staple food crop, but the yield varies, depending on weather conditions and the amount of irrigated land used for it. Production is also cyclical; when there are large surpluses of the grain, prices fall, discouraging production in the subsequent year. Output reached a high of nearly 5.2 million tonnes in 2003 but declined to 3.9 million tonnes in 2008 and to an estimated 2.6 million tonnes in 2010 as production continued to drop. In 2018, Sudan produced 4.9 million tons of sorghum, making it the world's third-largest producer. Exports in 2010 realized an estimated US$200,000. Wheat is also grown in irrigated areas as an import substitute. Its production varies in a pattern similar to that of sorghum, reacting to changes in prices. Production was 587,000 tonnes in 2008 but fell to 403,000 tonnes in 2010 because of a decrease in the cultivated area. As of 2018, Sudan produced 595,000 tons of wheat. Overall, grain production (sorghum, millet, and wheat) is insufficient for rising domestic demand, even with good harvests in recent years, requiring Sudan to depend upon imports, especially imports of wheat. As of 2018, Sudan produced 2.6 million tons of millet, making it the third largest producer in the world. Sugar production began in the 1960s to replace the second most expensive import after petroleum. The largest of the parastatal sugar projects, the Kananah Sugar Project, opened in 1981 and was important in eliminating sugar imports by 1986. In 1999 plans were announced for a large production facility in the White Nile region, with major funding from the Chinese government. Sudan and the People’s Republic of China also agreed to build a sixth sugar plant. And, in May 2002, Sudan inaugurated a new facility at the state-owned Sudan Sugar Company in New Haifa, which by the late 2000s produced 60,000 tonnes of white sugar per year.

The main types of cotton grown were medium-staple Akala, some long-staple Barakat, and a little long-medium staple Shambat B. A small amount of rain-fed, short-staple cotton was also grown. Cotton’s contribution to export revenue decreased from 53 percent in the 1970s to 1 percent in 2008. Exports of cotton provided US$134 million in earnings in 2008 but fell to an estimated US$40.4 million in 2010. In 2018, Sudan produced 160,000 tons of cotton. As of 2018, Sudan also produced 1.5 million tons of onions, 951,000 tons of banana, 907 thousand tons of mango (including mangosteen and guava), 674,000 tons of tomato, 442,000 tons of potato, 440,000 tons of date, 304,000 tons of okra, 283 thousand tons of lemon, 240,000 tons of cucumber, 234,000 tons of grapefruit, 234,000 tons of sweet potato, 187,000 tons of yam, 172,000 tons of watermelon, 161,000 tons of orange, and smaller quantities of other agricultural products. Irrigated agriculture Sudan had a modern irrigated agriculture sector totaling about 800,000 hectares in 2010, out of about 84 million hectares that were potentially arable. This was a slight decline from the prior year and well below the more than 2 million hectares of the early 1990s. The Nile and its tributaries were the source of water for 93 percent of irrigated agriculture, and of this, the Blue Nile accounted for about 67 percent. Gravity flow was the main form of irrigation, although pumps served part of the irrigated area. The waters of the Nile in Sudan were used for centuries for traditional irrigation, taking advantage of the annual Nile flood. Such usage continued in the early 2000s, along with the traditional shaduf (a device to raise water) and waterwheel to lift water to fields in local irrigation projects. These devices were rapidly being replaced by more efficient mechanized pumps. Among the first efforts to employ irrigation for modern commercial cropping was the use of the floodwaters of the Qash River and the Barakah River (both of which originate in Eritrea) in eastern Sudan to grow cotton on their deltas, which began in the 1860s. Between the 1940s and the 1970s, various projects were developed to irrigate land. Both deltas yielded only one crop a year, watered by the flood. Adequate groundwater, however, offered the eventual possibility of using pump irrigation from local wells for additional cropping or for supplementing any flood shortages. Since the 1950s, the government has constructed a number of large pump projects, mostly on the Blue Nile. These have included the Junayd project on the east bank of the Blue Nile east of the Gezira Scheme. In the 1970s, when the consumption and import of sugar grew rapidly, domestic production became a priority. Consequently, two major pump-irrigated sugar plantations were established on the White Nile in the Kosti area. The government's Dams Implementation Unit signed contracts in 2010 with two Chinese companies for a US$838 million project in northeastern Sudan.

The new dams were expected to contribute to the irrigation of some 210,000 hectares of agricultural land and to help revitalize land in the New Haifa Agricultural Scheme. Rainfed agriculture Cultivation dependent on rainfall falls into two categories. Most Sudanese farmers had always relied on rainfed fanning. In addition to these traditional farms, there is a large modern mechanized rainfed agricultural sector. Mechanized rainfed agriculture The mechanized rainfed agricultural sector developed after 1944-45, when a government project to cultivate the cracking clays of central Sudan started in the area of Al-Gedaref (also seen as Al-Qadarif). Its prime purpose was to meet the food needs of army units stationed in British colonies in East Africa (present-day Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda). The alkaline clays and loams in this area were not suitable for cultivation by hand or by oxen. An average of about 6,000 hectares a year was cultivated between 1945 and 1953, chiefly producing sorghum, under a sharecropping arrangement between the government and fanners who had been allocated land in the project. These estates proved costly, however, and in 1954 the government began encouraging the private sector to take up mechanized fanning in the area, a policy that continued after Sudan gained independence in 1956. The government maintained several state farms to demonstrate production methods and to conduct research, but research activities were very limited because of staffing and funding problems. The private-sector response was positive, and by 1960 mechanized farming had spread into other areas of the cracking-clay zone in central and eastern Sudan. The government set aside rectangular areas that were divided into plots of 420 hectares (later raised in places to 630 hectares) each. Half of these plots were leased to private fanners, the other half left fallow. After four years, the originally leased land was to be returned to fallow and the farmer was to receive a new lease for an adjacent fallow area. When the demand for land grew faster than it could be demarcated, areas outside the designated project limits were taken over by private individuals. The four-year lease proved unpopular because it meant new investment in clearing land every four years, and apparently much of the worked land continued to be cultivated while fallow land was also placed under cultivation. The investment requirements for mechanized farming favored prosperous cultivators, and eventually most farms came to be operated by entrepreneurs who raised capital through mortgageable property or other assets in the urban centers. Through arrangements with other individuals, these entrepreneurs frequently managed to control additional plots beyond the legal limit of two. Their ability to obtain capital permitted them also to abandon depleted land and to move into newly demarcated uncleared areas, a practice that had a deleterious impact on the environment, deprived the indigenous inhabitants of work opportunities, and increased desertification.

With loans from the IDA, the MFC was able to provide technical assistance, credit for land clearing and machinery, and marketing aid to individual farmers and cooperative groups. The MFC also became the operator of state farms. The area under this system of management by the late 1990s had spread to about 5.9 million hectares in the states of Al-Gedaref, Blue Nile, Upper Nile, White Nile, Sinnar, and South Kordofan. The farms were then usually well over 420 hectares as a result of combining leased plots and creating family partnerships. The government also allocated large plots of 21,000^420,000 hectares to Sudanese and Gulf state investors. Only a few crops were suitable for cultivation in the cracking-clay area, principally sorghum. Sesame and short-fiber cotton also grew successfully but in relatively smaller quantities. Land preparation, seeding, and most threshing were mechanized on these farms, but some threshing, as well as weeding and harvesting, was done by seasonal labor. Traditional rain-fed agriculture Traditional rain-fed farming involves nomadic and seminomadic peoples and transhumance, as well as settled agriculture, which also includes significant numbers of livestock. Although almost all these systems exist in every state, they are most prevalent in the Kordofan and Darfur States, Sinnar, and the Blue Nile and White Nile States. Livestock, part of almost every farming system, serve as both a capital asset and a hedge against the risk of farming, particularly because of recurrent droughts. Settled farmers usually produce a combination of food crops and cash crops, such as karkade (hibiscus), sesame, and watermelon, on 4.2 to 6.3 hectares. The total area under crops in the traditional rain-fed fanning system in 2010 was estimated to be almost 12 million hectares. South Sudan has three zones where traditional agricultural systems prevail. The Central Rainlands Zone in Upper Nile State receives less than 800 millimeters of rainfall per year. Vegetation in the zone is open grasslands, bush thickets, and thorn woodland where quick-maturing grains and oilseeds are produced. Semi-mechanized farming has begun to take over where farm size is large enough to break even on the investment. The Flood Plains Zone includes the remainder of the Upper Nile State and also parts of Bahr al-Ghazal and Equatoria. Rainfall ranges from 800 to 1,000 millimeters per year, concentrated in six to seven months. Vegetation is open grasslands with acacia woodlands. The sudd, in this area, is a permanent or semipermanent swamp that mainly produces papyrus. Farming takes place on the high land; the lower land is the most important cattle-grazing land in the South. The Equatorial Zone includes the Ironstone Plateau, the Central Hills, and the Green Belt in Equatoria. Rainfall is usually 900-1,300 millimeters per year, concentrated in six to eight months, although it is much higher in the Green Belt. Farm production includes perennial tree crops, such as coffee, tea, and oil palm, and annual crops, such as tobacco, cotton, com, sorghum, groundnuts, sesame, and vegetables.

        "prompt": "to raise livestock in the area. Animal husbandry Livestock raising is important throughout Sudan except in the extremely dry areas of the North. It provides a large part or the entire livelihood of nearly half the population of Sudan, mainly in the traditional farming sector. In recent years, the government has encouraged commercial livestock production of camels, goats, sheep, and cattle for sale abroad. The range of offerings in the sector includes live animal exports, meat, hides and skins, and dairy products. Livestock is of increasing importance in the agricultural economy, and it has become the fastest growing non-oil export sector. The Arab states of the Persian Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia, are the source of especially strong demand for Sudan’s livestock. Sudanese cattle are of two principal varieties: Baqqara and Nilotic. The Baqqara and two subvarieties constitute the majority of the country’s cattle. This breed is found chiefly in the western savanna regions and in fewer, although significant, numbers farther to the east as far north as Kassala. Because of periodic rinderpest epidemics, the total number of cattle was relatively small until about 1930. A vaccination program begun about that time, and mass inoculations during the succeeding decades resulted in a great increase in numbers. In the vast areas used by pastoral herders, cattle husbandry is conducted in an economic, cultural, and social context that evolved over generations. This includes an emphasis on increasing herd size as an investment for future family security. Small surpluses (usually bulls) are available for subsistence use, exchange, or sale for local consumption or export. Cattle are also used for marriage payments and for rituals. Numbers of cattle help to establish or increase status and power in a social system in which cattle are the measure of wealth. Transhumant groups own most of the Nilotic variety of cattle, and their migrations, related to the wet and dry seasons, usually do not exceed 150-160 kilometers. The majority of Baqqara cattle belong to the Baqqara Arabs, who were once largely nomadic, but since at least the early 1900s usually maintained a settled base in which to cultivate crops. The farmers, their relatives, or their agents move the cattle over traditional migratory routes northward during the rainy season and southward to the area of the Bahr al-Arab as the dry season progresses. Migrations in either direction might amount to 400 kilometers. The expansion of mechanized rain-fed agriculture in the region used by the Baqqara, continued government efforts to enlarge the cultivated area, and pressures on the land from the growing population gradually reduced grazing areas. At the same time, traditional cultural forces brought about a steady increase in cattle numbers. The result was a growing overstock and pasture depletion until the outbreak of civil war in 1983, which was followed by the devastating droughts of the 1980s and early 1990s that greatly reduced livestock numbers throughout Sudan.

Fodder comes from crop residues on irrigated and rain-fed farms and from vegetation along the rivers and canals. Goats, of which there are three principal breeds (desert, Nubian, and Nilotic), are found throughout the country south of the northern desert areas. They are raised mainly by settled families for milk and meat. Goat meat, although less popular than mutton, forms part of the diet of most families, particularly the poorer ones. Goat milk is an important source of protein, and many families in urban areas keep a few goats for their milk. Camel farming in Sudan is largely concentrated in the desert and subdesert regions of northern Darfur, northern Kordofan, and southern Al-Gedaref. They are kept almost entirely by nomadic and seminomadic peoples, for whom the animal represents the preferred mode of transport. Camels are also important for milk and for meat. Camel ownership and numbers are sources of prestige in nomadic societies. Donkeys, horses, and a small number of pigs (kept by such non-Muslim peoples as the Nuba) are also raised in Sudan. Poultry is raised mainly by farm families and villagers, although a modern sector consisting of government commercial operations and some semicommercial private ventures has developed. A significant poultry industry exists in Khartoum, and beekeeping has also been introduced. In 1983 Sudan’s more than 50 million animals comprised the second largest national herd in Africa, exceeded only by that of Ethiopia. By 1991 the herd had been reduced by perhaps one-third by the droughts of the 1980s-1991, the August 1988 floods in the South, described as the worst in Sudan's history, and the ravages of civil war in the South. Many families and indeed whole ethnic groups, who traditionally survived on their cattle, sheep, goats, or camels, lost all of their herds and were forced to migrate to the Three Towns (Omdurman, Khartoum, and Khartoum North) in search of sustenance. Total livestock production increased rapidly in the second half of the 1990s. The numbers of sheep quadrupled in the 1990s in response to the export market in the Persian Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia. In 2000, however, exports were affected by an outbreak of Rift Valley fever in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government blamed the problem on livestock imported from East Africa, and Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states placed a ban on imports from the region, which had a severe impact on Sudan’s livestock sector. By 2004, livestock had rebounded from the impact of drought, floods, and Gulf-state import bans, with sales in that year of US$134 million. Another outbreak of Rift Valley fever caused some losses once again in 2007-8 and resulted in temporary import restrictions against Sudanese livestock. Sales declined to US$80 million in 2007, and to US$42 million in 2008. Total livestock numbered almost 142 million head in 2010, including nearly 42 million cattle, 52 million sheep, 43.4 million goats, and",

Further growth of the sector was predicted as Gulf investors, particularly from Saudi Arabia, had committed to investment in new production facilities. However, despite the immense potential, agriculture in Sudan faces several challenges, including poor infrastructure, inadequate access to credit and markets, recurrent conflicts, and climate change. Poor infrastructure limits the Sudanese farmers' accessibility to not just the local market but also the global market. On the other hand, inadequate access to credit and markets means these farmers have a hard time accessing capital which also affects their production The recurrent conflicts in the country, especially since overthrowing former President Al-Bashir, have also affected agriculture.

Patrick and Jonathan Stagge were pen names under which Hugh Callingham Wheeler (19 March 1912 – 26 July 1987), Richard Wilson Webb (August 1901 – December 1966), Martha Mott Kelley (30 April 1906 – 2005) and Mary Louise White Aswell (3 June 1902 – 24 December 1984) wrote detective fiction. In some foreign countries their books have been published under the variant Quentin Patrick. Most of the stories were written by Webb and Wheeler in collaboration, or by Wheeler alone. Their most famous creation is the amateur sleuth Peter Duluth. In 1963, the story collection The Ordeal of Mrs. Snow was given a Special Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America. In 1949, the book Puzzle for Pilgrims won the Grand Prix de Littérature Policière International Prize, the most prestigious award for crime and detective fiction in France. History In 1931, Martha Mott Kelley and Richard Wilson Webb collaborated on the detective novel Cottage Sinister. Kelley was known as Patsy (Patsy Kelly was a well-known character actress of that era) and Webb—an Englishman (born 1901 in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset) who worked for a pharmaceutical company in Philadelphia—was known as Rick, so they created the pseudonym Q. Patrick by combining their nicknames—adding the Q \"because it was unusual\". Webb and Kelley's literary partnership soon ended, with Kelley's marriage to Stephen Shipley Wilson. Webb continued to write under the Q. Patrick name, while looking for a new writing partner. Although he wrote two novels with the journalist and Harper's Bazaar editor Mary Louise Aswell, he would find his permanent collaborator in Hugh Wheeler, a Londoner who had moved to the US in 1934. Wheeler's and Webb's first collaboration was published in 1936. That same year, they introduced two new pseudonyms: Murder Gone to Earth, the first novel featuring Dr. Westlake, was credited to Jonathan Stagge, a name they would continue to use for the rest of the Westlake series. A Puzzle for Fools introduced Peter Duluth and was signed Patrick Quentin. This would become their primary and most famous pen name, even though they also continued to use Q. Patrick until the end of their collaboration (particularly for Inspector Trant stories). In the late 1940s, Webb's contributions gradually decreased due to health problems. From the 1950s and on, Wheeler continued writing as Patrick Quentin on his own, and also had one book published under his own name. In the 1960s and '70s, Wheeler achieved success as a playwright and librettist, and",

        "prompt": "output as Quentin Patrick slowed and then ceased altogether after 1965. However, Wheeler did write the book for the 1979 musical Sweeney Todd about a fictional London mass murderer, showing he had not altogether abandoned the genre. Writing The early Q. Patrick detective stories generally follow the Golden Age \"whodunit\" conventions, with elaborate puzzle mysteries reminiscent of Agatha Christie or John Dickson Carr. From the time when Wheeler joined the writing, the stories become more psychologically acute, with increasingly realistic, fleshed-out characters. In the 1940s, the stories start to move away from the traditional detective pattern: Puzzle for Fiends is a Hitchcockian thriller, Puzzle for Pilgrims a film noir in written form, and Run to Death a pulpy spy novel. The majority of the Webb–Wheeler collaborations feature one of their recurring characters: Peter Duluth, a Broadway director, WWII veteran and recovering alcoholic who, with his wife Iris, always seems to stumble across murders; Inspector Timothy Trant of the New York City Police, a Princeton University-educated dandy whose remorseless investigations often seem to be aimed at some innocent person before he reveals his real target; and the country doctor, Dr. Hugh Cavendish Westlake with his daughter Dawn. When Webb bowed out on the writing, these characters disappeared or receded into the background. The late Patrick Quentin novels are increasingly dark and brooding. Deceit and betrayal, particularly adultery, already a frequent theme, becomes even more central. Although at the end of the story the murder is solved, the impact of the crime, and the corruption uncovered in the investigation, remain. A study of all the Q.Patrick/Patrick Quentin/Jonathan Stagge novels has appeared in French, Patrick Quentin: Du roman-probleme au Thriller Psychologique by Roland Lacourbe, Vincent Bourgeois, Phillippe Fooz and Michel Soupart (France: Semper Aenigma, 2016). Legacy At one time a relatively popular mystery writer (Francis Iles called Quentin \"number one among American crime writers\"), Quentin has largely fallen into obscurity in the US, his works out of print. He probably is better known in Scandinavia, where he used to be among the most famous detective writers, although his reputation is fading there as well. A few of Quentin's stories have been filmed (see below), most notably the Peter Duluth mystery Black Widow, which was filmed under that title by Twentieth Century Fox in 1954 as a color Cinemascope feature. Van Heflin portrayed the Peter Duluth character, who for some reason was renamed Peter Denver. Works variously by Richard Wilson Webb, Hugh Wheeler, Martha Mott Kelley and Mary Louise Aswell As 'Q.

Performers disguise the fact that it is a performance from those who observe and who may choose to participate in it, thus leading spectators to view it as a real, unstaged event. The Brazilian theater practitioner Augusto Boal and Panagiotis Assimakopoulos developed the form during their time in Argentina in the 1960s as part of Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed, which focused on oppression and social issues. Invisible theatre developed in the context of increasingly repressive dictatorship in Brazil and Argentina. The purpose of invisible theatre was to show oppression in everyday life, in an everyday setting, without the audience or \"spect-actors\" knowing. Boal went on to develop forum theater. Invisible theatre in Argentina Invisible theatre was developed in Buenos Aires as public and participatory action that avoided police authority. The Brazilian Augusto Boal was in exile in Argentina from 1971 to 1976 and created his first invisible theatre experiment in collaboration with a group of actors. The performance took place in a busy restaurant at lunchtime, with actors sitting at different tables. One actor ordered à la carte, but at the end of the lunch told the waiter that he could not pay the 70 soles. He offered to pay with his labour and asked the waiter how much he would get paid taking out the rubbish. Another actor, seated at another table, informed the customers that a rubbish collector gets paid 7 sole per hour. Yet another actor, at yet another table, told everyone that a gardener gets 10 soles per hour. Eventually another member of the cast started to collect money from the restaurant customers to pay the bill. Boal took theatre to an audience who did not recognise that they were the audience; he argued it was critical that actors participating in the invisible theatre did not reveal that they were actors. In its early phase, invisible theatre aimed to raise public awareness of class differences and to provide a forum for articulating dissent. Invisible theatre in Europe In the late 1970s and the early 1980s Boal staged invisible theatre performances in Sicily, Stockholm, Paris and other European cities, in public locations like the Paris Metro and on Stockholm ferries. These performances tackled issues such as racism, ageism, sexism and homelessness. Invisible theatre in Brazil When Boal returned to Brazil in 1986, he produced a weekly invisible theatre for a Rio TV station. In one episode a dark-skinned man sold himself as a slave in the market, informing the crowd that he earned less than a 19th-century slave. Comparison to happenings Historically, invisible theatre developed after happenings had been staged in Argentina by Oscar Mosatta. Mosatta had staged happenings in the late 1960s after he had attended such performances in New York in 1966. While happenings are also used to raise awareness about an issue, take place outside a theatre or gallery, and are scripted, the audience is",

The first script commissioned was \"The Cosmic Comet\". The pilot episode \"Diamond Ray of Disappearance\" (MU004), was the fourth script approved but the first episode produced and intended to air first, which indeed it did in the U.K., U.S. and many markets. Season 1 (1983) Season 2 (1984) Broadcast order There is a lot of confusion over the exact order of the episodes of the series. The production codes allocated appear to indicate nothing more than the formal clearance of an episode's script. Often, this order is directly contradicted on screen For example, \"The Return of Orko's Uncle\" (MU023) has an earlier production code than the introduction of \"Orko's Favourite Uncle\" (MU027).

Nezāmi is considered the greatest romantic epic poet in Persian literature, who brought a colloquial and realistic style to the Persian epic. His heritage is widely appreciated and shared by Afghanistan, Republic of Azerbaijan, Iran, the Kurdistan region and Tajikistan. Life Born of a Persian family, his personal name was Ilyas and his chosen pen-name was Nezami (also spelled as Nizami and Neẓāmi). He was born of an urban background in Ganja (Seljuq empire, now Republic of Azerbaijan) and is believed to have spent his whole life in South Caucasus. According to De Blois, Ganja was a city which at that time had predominantly an Iranian population. The Armenian historian Kirakos Gandzaketsi (c. 1200 – 1271) mentions that: \"This city was densely populated with Iranians and a small number of Christians\". Because Nezami was not a court poet, he does not appear in the annals of the dynasties. Tazkerehs, which are the compilations of literary memoirs that include maxims of the great poets along with biographical information and commentary of styles refer to him briefly. Much of this material in these Tazkerehs are based on legends, anecdotes, and hearsays. Consequently, few facts are known about Nezami's life, the only source being his own work, which does not provide much information on his personal life. Parents Nezami was orphaned early and was raised by his maternal uncle Khwaja Umar who took responsibility for him and afforded him an excellent education. His mother, named Ra'isa, was of Kurdish origin. His father, whose name was Yusuf is mentioned once by Nezami in his poetry. In the same verse, Nezami mentions his grandfather's name as Zakki. In part of the same verse, some have taken the word Mu'ayyad as a title for Zakki while others have interpreted it as the name of his great-grandfather. Some sources have stated",

His first wife was an enslaved Kipchak who was sent to him by Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of Darband, as part of a larger gift. According to Iraj Bashiri she became Nezami's \"most beloved\" wife. His only son Mohammad was from this wife. She died after \"Khosrow and Shirin\" was completed. Mohammad was seven at the time. Nezami mentions his son again in Layli and Majnun adding that now this son is 14 years old and \"apple of my eyes\". In \"Haft Peykar\" (Seven Beauties), he also mentions and advises his son about taking more responsibility as the father was growing more frail. Some modern writers in the late 20th century have claimed that this wife was called Afaq. Vahid Dastgerdi seems to be the first writer to propose this name for Nezami's first wife, but Said Nafisi (at the same time) and a recent source have challenged this interpretation of the corresponding verse in Nezami's work and the assumption that Afaq was the real name of his wife and have taken the Afaq in that verse to simply mean \"horizon\" rather than a proper name. Strangely enough, Nezami's two other wives, too, died prematurely – the death of each coinciding with the completion of an epic, prompting the poet to say, \"God, why is it that for every mathnavi I must sacrifice a wife!\". Education Nezami was not a philosopher in the sense of Avicenna or an expositor of theoretical Sufism in the sense of Ibn 'Arabi. However, he is regarded as a philosopher and gnostic who mastered various fields of Islamic thoughts which he synthesized in a way that brings to mind the traditions of later Hakims such as Qutb al-Din Shirazi. Often referred to by the honorific Hakim (\"the Sage\"), Nezami is both a learned poet and master of a lyrical and sensuous style. About Nezami's prodigious learning there is no doubt. Poets were expected to be well versed in many subjects; but Nezami seems to have been exceptionally so. His poems show that not only he was fully acquainted with Arabic and Persian literatures and with oral and written popular and local traditions, but was also familiar with such diverse fields as mathematics, astronomy, astrology, alchemy, medicine, botany, Koranic exegesis, Islamic theory and law, Iranian myths and legends, history, ethics, philosophy and esoteric thought, music, and the visual arts. His strong character, social sensibility, and knowledge of oral and written historical records, as well as his rich Persian cultural heritage unite pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran into the creation of a new standard of literary achievement. Being a product of the Iranian culture of the time, he not only created a bridge between pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran, but also between Iran and the whole ancient world.

Unlike other parts of Persia, where the poets mostly belonged to higher echelons of society such as scholars, bureaucrats, and secretaries, a good number of poets in the northwestern areas rose from among the common people with working-class backgrounds, and they frequently used colloquial expressions in their poetry. Accordingly, the book demonstrates the social conditions at the time, reflecting the full spread of Persian language and the culture in the region, which is evidenced by the common use of spoken idioms in poems and the professions of many of the poets. The influence of the northwestern Pahlavi language, for example, which had been the spoken dialect of the region, is clearly observed in the poems contained in this anthology. However, at the same time, the Caucasus region was entertaining a unique mixture of ethnic cultures. Khaqani's mother was a Nestorian Christian, Mojir Baylqani's mother was an Armenian, and Nezami's mother was a Kurd. Their works reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the region. By the end of the 10th century, Persian literature became widespread from the eastern Mediterranean to the banks of the Indus. The earliest extant example of Persian poetry from the area is that of Qatran Tabrizi (1009–1072) who served in the courts of the Shaddadid and Rawadid dynasties. Qatran Tabrizi, is credited with what some scholars in the last century have termed as the founder of the \"Azerbaijan\" or \"Trans-Cacausian\" school or \"Tabriz School\" or \"Shirvan School\" or \"Arranian Style\" of Persian poetry. This school produced a distinctive style of poetry in Persian, which contrasted with \"Khurasani\" (\"Eastern\") style in its rhetorical sophistication, its innovative use of metaphor, its use of technical terminology and Christian imagery, the presence of Persian archaism while borrowing from Arabic vocabulary, as well as new concepts. Other sources including the Encyclopaedia of Islam and traditional Iranian literary sources have used the term \"'Iraqi\" style for the Persian poetry of Nezami. The Seljuqs took control of Ganja from the Shaddadids in 1075 and spread Persian literary westwards to their courts. In the middle of the 12th century, the Seljuk Empire's control of the region weakened and their provincial governors, virtually autonomous local princes, further encouraged Persian culture, art and poetry in their courts. Persian culture characteristically flourished in this era, when political power was diffused and Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil servants and merchants were in great demand and rival dynasties continued to vie for the service of Persian poets. This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived. Nezami was patronized by different rulers and dedicated his epics to various rival dynasties, including the Seljuqs, Eldiguzids (who maintained control of Ganja during most of the later 12th century), Shirvanshahs, the ruler of Ahar and Ahmadilis. Although he enjoyed the patronage of various rulers and princes, he avoided the courts and is generally believed to have lived a secluded life.

According to literary scholar Chelkowski, \"it seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading Firdawsi's monumental epic Shahnameh (The book of Kings). Nezami mentioned Ferdowsi as the Sage (Hakim) and Knower/Wise (daanaa) and the great master of discourse, \"who has decorated words like new bride.\" Nezami advises the son of the Shirvanshah to read the Shah-nama and to remember the meaningful sayings of the wise. Nezami used the Shahnameh as a source in his three epics of Haft Peykar, Khosrow and Shirin and Eskandar-Nameh. The story of Vis and Ramin also had an immense influence on Nezami. Although Nezami takes the bases for most of his plots from Ferdowsi, but the basis for his rhetoric comes from Gorgani. This is especially noticeable in Khosrow and Shirin, which is of the same meter and imitates some scenes from Vis and Ramin. Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in Vis and Ramin. Nezami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the Sufi influences, which are seen in Nezami's epic poetry. The first monumental work of Nezami, the Makhzan al-Asrar is influenced by Sanai's Hadikat al-Hakika. Nezami acknowledges this, but considers his work to be superior. The main similarities between Sanai's poem and Nezami's are in its ethico-philosophical genre, although Nezami uses a different metre and organized the whole work in a different fashion. Khaqani Sherwani daring imagery, was to have a momentous influence on Nezami Ganjavi and through the latter on Persian poetry in general. Works Nezami lived in an age of both political instability and intense intellectual activity, which his poems reflect; but little is known about his life, his relations with his patrons, or the precise dates of his works, as the many legends built up around the poet color the accounts of his later biographers. He dedicated his poems to various rulers of the region as was custom of that time for great poets, but avoided court life. Nezami was a master of the Masnavi style (double-rhymed verses). The Khamsa or Panj Ganj Nizami's main poetical work, for which he is best known, is a set of five long narrative poems known as the Khamsa (, 'Quintet or Quinary') or Panj Ganj (, 'Five Treasures'): Makhzan-ol-Asrâr (, 'The Treasury or Storehouse of Mysteries'), 1163 (some date it 1176) Khosrow o Shirin (, 'Khosrow and Shirin'), 1177–1180 Leyli o Majnun (, 'Layla and Majnun'), 1192 Eskandar-Nâmeh (, 'The Book of Alexander'), 1194 or 1196–1202 Haft Peykar (, 'The Seven Beauties'), 1197 The first of these poems, Makhzan-ol-Asrâr, was influenced by Sanai's (d. 1131) monumental Garden of Truth. The four other poems are medieval romances.

In all these cases, Nezami reworked the material from his sources in a substantial way. The Khamsa was a popular subject for lavish manuscripts illustrated with painted miniatures at the Persian and Mughal courts in later centuries. Examples include the Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208), created for the Mughal Emperor Akbar in the 1590s. Makhzan-ol-Asrâr The ethico-philosophical poems of about 2,250 Persian distichs was dedicated to Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of Erzinjan. The story deals with such esoteric subjects as philosophy and theology. The story contains twenty discourses, each of them portraying an exemplary story on religious and ethical topics. Each chapter concludes with apostrophe to the poet himself containing his pen name. The content of the poems are indicated in the heading to each chapter and are written in a typical Homiletics style. The stories which discuss spiritual and practical concerns enjoin kingly justice, riddance of hypocrisy, warning of vanity of this world and the need to prepare for the after-life. The general message of the discourse is that Nezami preaches the ideal way of life drawing attention to his reader of the supreme rank man among God's creatures and approaching of the end life and the necessity of man becoming aware of his spiritual destination. In a few chapters he address the duties of a king, but as a whole he addresses himself to mankind in general rather than to his royal patrons. In the introduction, the poet provides an account of his solitary vigils, called Khalwat. There is no indication that these were Sufi vigils, but they are used as a literary fantasy on the spiritually-inclined poet he wanted to be. In highly rhetorical style, the aim he pursues is to transcend the limitation of secular literature of the courts. With this work, Nezami joins the destination of Persian poetry, which had started with Sanai and was continued by others, in the first place by Attar. Not a romantic epic, \"The Treasury of Mysteries\" was translated into English by Gholam H. Darab in 1945. After this early work, Nezami turned towards narrative poetry. Khosrow o Shirin A story of pre-Islamic Persian origin which is found in the great epico-historical poems of Shahnameh and is based on a true story that was further romanticized by Persian poets. The story chosen by Nezami, was commissioned and dedicated to the Seljuk Sultan Toghril II, the Atabek Muhammad ibn Eldiguz Jahan Pahlavan and his brother Qizil Arslan. It contains about 6,500 distichs in length, the story depicts the love of Sassanian Khosrow II Parviz towards his Armenian princess Shirin. Khusrow and Shirin recounts the story of King Khosrow's courtship of Princess Shirin, and the vanquishing of his love-rival, Farhad.

Pure and selfless love is represented here embodied in the figure of Farhad, secretly in love with Shirin, who falls victim to the king's ire and jealousy. The influence of Vis o Ramin is visible as the poem imitates a major scene (that of the lovers arguing in the snow) from Vis o Rāmin, as well as being in the same meter (hazaj) as Gorgāni's poem. Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in Vis o Rāmin. In turn, Nezami's great work had a tremendous influence on later authors and many imitations of this work were made. With complete artistic and structural unity, the epic of Khosrow o Shirin turned to be a turning point not only for Nizami but for all of Persian literature. Leyli o Majnun A story of Arabic origin which was later adapted and embellished by the Persians. The poem of 4,600 distichs was dedicated, in 1192, to Abu al-Muzaffar Shirvanshah, who claimed descent from the Sassanid King, whose exploits are reflected in Nezami's \"Seven Beauties\" (Haft Paykar). The poem is based on the popular Arab legend of ill-starred lovers: the poet Qays falls in love with his cousin Layla, but is prevented from marrying her by Layla's father. Layla's father forbids contact with Qays, so that Qays becomes obsessed and starts singing of his love for Layla in public. The obsession becomes so severe that he sees and evaluates everything in terms of Layla; hence his sobriquet \"the possessed\" (Majnun). Realizing that he cannot obtain union, even when other people intercede for him, he leaves society and roams naked in the desert among the beasts. However the image of Layla was so ingrained in him that he cannot eat or sleep. His only activity becomes composing poetry of longing for Layla. Meanwhile, Layla is married against her will, but she guards her virginity by resisting the advances of her husband. In a secret meeting with Majnun, they meet, but have no physical contact. Rather, they recite poetry to each other from a distance. Layla's husband dies eventually, which removes the legal obstacles to a licit union. However Majnun is so focused on the ideal picture of Layla in his mind, that he fled into the desert again. Layla dies out of grief and is buried in her bridal dress. Hearing this news, Majun rushes to her grave, where he instantly dies. They are buried side by side and their grave becomes a site of pilgrimage. Someone dreams that in Paradise they are united and live as a king and queen. Nezami composed his romance at the request of the Shirvanshah Akhsatan.

Nezami used many Arabic anecdotes in the story, but also adds a strong Persian flavor to the legend. An important aspect of Layla and Majun is the poet's highly humanitarian approach. During the war by Nawfal in favor of Majnun, the latter is unhappy wishing the termination of the war. Majun gives away his horse and amours to save a gazelle and a stag. Nezami gave a Persian character to the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc. Further, he adapted the different stories about Majnun to fit a well-crafted Persian romantic epic. The Story of Layla and Majnun by Nizami, was edited and translated into English by Swiss scholar of Islamic culture Rudolf Gelpke and published in 1966. A comprehensive analysis in English containing partial translations of Nezami's romance Layla and Majnun examining key themes such as chastity, constancy and suffering through an analysis of the main characters was published by Ali Asghar Seyed-Gohrab. Eskandar-Nâmeh The Romance of Alexander the Great contains 10,500 distichs. There are differences of opinion on whether this or the Haft Paykar was Nezami's last epic. The names of its dedicatees are uncertain, but the ruler of Ahar, Nosart al-Din Bishkin b. Mohammad has been mentioned. The story is based on Islamic myths developed about Alexander the Great, which derive from Qur'anic references to the Dhu'l-Qarnayn as well as from the Greek Alexander romance of Pseudo-Callisthenes. It consists of two books, Sharaf-Nama and Iqbal-nameh. The poem narrates the three stages in Alexander's life: first as the conqueror of the world; then as a seeker after knowledge, gaining enough wisdom to acknowledge his own ignorance; and finally as a prophet, traveling once again across the world, from west to east, and south to north to proclaim his monotheistic creed to the world at large. The Sharaf-nama discusses the birth of Alexander, his succession to the throne of Rum (Greece), his wars against Africans who invaded Egypt, his conquest of Persia and his marriage to the daughter of Darius. The episode also discusses Alexander's pilgrimage to Mecca, his stay in the Caucasus and his visit to Queen Nushaba of Barda' and her court of Amazons. Alexander conquers India, China and the land of the Rus. The Sharafnama concludes with Alexander's unsuccessful search for the water of immortal life. The Iqbal-nameh is a description of Alexander's personal growth into the ideal ruler on a model ultimately derived, through Islamic intermediaries, from Plato's Republic. He has debates with Greek and Indian philosophers (c.f. with Garshaspnama) and a major portion of the text is devoted to the discourses he has with seven Greek sages. The poet then tells of Alexander's end and adds an account of the circumstances of the death of each of the seven sages. Nezami's image of Alexander is that of an Iranian knight.

Haft Peykar A pre-Islamic story of Persian origin, it was dedicated to the ruler of Maragha, 'Ala' Al-Din korp Arslan. It is the story of Bahram V, the Sassanid king, who is born to Yazdegerd after twenty years of childlessness and supplication to Ahura Mazda for a child. The Haft Peykar is a romanticized biography of the Sasanian Persian empire ruler Bahram Gur. His adventurous life had already been treated by Ferdowsi in the Shahnama, to which fact Nezami alludes a number of times. In general, his method is to omit those episodes that the earlier poet had treated, or to touch on them only very briefly, and to concentrate on new material. The poet starts by giving an account of the birth of Bahram Gur and his upbringing in the court of the Arab King No'man and his fabled palace Khwarnaq. Bahram whose upbringing is entrusted to No'man becomes a formidable huntsman. While wandering through the fabled palace, he discovers a locked room which contains a depiction of seven princesses; hence the name Haft Peykar (seven beauties). Each of these princesses is from the seven different climes (traditional Zoroastrian-Islamic division of the Earth) and he falls in love with them. His father Yazdegerd I passes away and Bahram returns to Persia to claim his throne from pretenders. After some episodes he is recognized as King and rescues the Persians from a famine. Once the country is stable, the King searches for the seven princesses and wins them as his brides. His architect is ordered to construct seven domes for each of his new brides. The architect tells him that each of the seven climes is ruled by one of the seven planets (classical planetary system of Zoroastrian-Islamic world) and advises him to assure good fortune by adorning each dome with the color that is associated with each clime and planet. Bahram is skeptical but follows the advice of the architect. The princesses take up residence in the splendid pavilions. On each visit, the king visits the princesses on successive days of the week; on Saturday the Indian princess, who is governed by Saturn and so on. The princesses names are Furak (Nurak), the daughter of the Rajah of India, as beautiful as the moon; Yaghma Naz, the daughter of the Khaqan of the Turks; Naz Pari, the daughter of the king of Khwarazm; Nasrin Nush, the daughter of the king of the Slavs; Azarbin (Azareyon), the daughter of the king of Morocco; Humay, the daughter of the Roman Caesar; and Diroste (wholesome), a beautiful Iranian princess from the House of Kay Ka'us. Each princess relates to the king a story matching the mood of her respective color. These seven beautifully constructed, highly sensuous stories occupy about half of the whole poem. While the king is busy with the seven brides, his evil minister seizes power in the realm. Bahram Gur discovers that the affairs of Persia are in disarray, the treasury is empty and",

He starts investigating the corrupt minister and from the multitude of complaints, he selects seven who tell him the injustice they have suffered. The minister is subsequently put to death and Bahram Gur restores justice and orders the seven pleasure-domes to be converted to fire temples for the pleasure of God. Bahram then goes hunting for the last time but mysteriously disappears. As a pun on words, while trying to hunt the wild ass (gūr) he instead finds his tomb (gūr). Ritter, in his introduction to the critical edition describes it as: \"the best and most beautiful epic in New Persian poetry and at the same time [. . .] one of the most important poetical creations of the whole of oriental Indo-European literature\". The Haft Peykar is considered the poet's masterpiece. Overall, Nezami illustrates the harmony of the universe, the affinity of the sacred and the profane, and the concordance of ancient and Islamic Iran. The story was translated to English in 1924 by Charles Edward Wilson. A newer English rendering based on more complete manuscripts was accomplished by Julie Scott Meysami in 1995. The following lines present an excerpt (Original Persian): Other poetry Only a small corpus of his Persian lyric poetry, mainly qaṣīdahs (\"odes\") and ghazals (\"lyrics\") have survived. Ten of his quatrains have also been recorded in the anthology Nozhat al-Majales (which was compiled around 1250) by Jamal Khalil Shirvani along with 23 other poets from Ganja. A famous ghazal of Nezami talks about altruism as the path for reaching the ultimate spiritual goal: Legacy Nizami, whose works are all written in Persian, has a very high reputation in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan, where Persian is the official language. His poetry is especially well known in Iran, and is also very popular in Azerbaijan, where his birthplace and mausoleum are located. He is known in other countries, especially in India and Pakistan . Persian culture The influence of Neẓāmi's work on the subsequent development of Persian literature has been enormous and the Khamseh became a pattern that was emulated in later Persian poetry (and also in other Islamic literatures). The legacy of Nezami is widely felt in the Islamic world and his poetry has influenced the development of Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish and Urdu poetry amongst many other languages. In the history of Persian miniature painting, the stories in Nezami's poems alongside those of Ferdowsi's Shahnama have been the most frequently illustrated literary works. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, Nezami is \"admired in Persian-speaking lands for his originality and clarity of style, though his love of language for its own sake and of philosophical and scientific learning makes his work difficult for the average reader.\" Nezami composed his verses in Persian language and",

Not only poets, but also historians such as Rawandi were influenced by Nezami's poetry and used his poems as a source for rendering history. Besides these, scores of poets have started their composition with the first line of the Makhzan al-Asrar. According to Rudolf Gelpke, \"Many later poets have imitated Nizami's work, even if they could not equal and certainly not surpass it; Persians, Turks, Indians, to name only the most important ones. The Persian scholar Hekmat has listed not less than forty Persian and thirteen Turkish versions of Layli and Majnun.\" According to Vahid Dastgerdi, \"If one would search all existing libraries, one would probably find more than 1000 versions of Layla and Majnun.\" Jami in his Nafahatol Ons remarks that: \"Although most of Nezami's work on the surface appear to be romance, in reality they are a mask for the essential truths and for the explanation of divine knowledge.\" Jami in his Baharestan mentions that \"Nezami's excellence is more manifest than the sun and has no need of description. Hashemi of Kerman remarks: The empire of poetry obtained its law and order from Nezami's beautiful verses and To present words before Nezami's silent speech is a waste of time.\" Ganjavi poems in the Indian subcontinent Ganjavi's poems were very popular in the Indian subcontinent.

Soviet Union In the early 1940s and to mark the 800th anniversary of Nizami Ganjavi, Azerbaijani composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov planned to write seven songs based on Nizami's poem about the Seven Beauties. However Hajibeyov wrote only two songs: Sensiz (Without You, 1941) and Sevgili Janan (Beloved, 1943). Another Azerbaijani composer Gara Garayev, composed Seven Beauties (ballet) in 1947–48 based on Nizami's eponymous poem that won an international acclaim. He also composed Leyli and Majnun (ballet) that premiered on 25 May 1969 at the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater in Baku and later was recorded as a film. A minor planet, called 3770 Nizami, was discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh in 1974 and named after him. Further, the Museum of Azerbaijan literature in Baku is named after Nizami. Azerbaijan Nezami was depicted on the obverse of the Azerbaijani 500 manat banknote of 1993–2006. In 2008, coinciding with the 800th anniversary of his death, the National Bank of Azerbaijan minted a 100 manat gold commemorative coin dedicated to his memory. The Nizami Museum of Literature is located in Baku, Republic of Azerbaijan. One of the Baku Metro stations is also named after Nizami Ganjavi. There is Institute of Literature named after Nizami and Cinema named after Nizami in Baku. One of the districts of Baku is called Nizami raion. The life of Nizami Ganjavi is shown in the Azerbaijani movie \"Nizami\" (1982), in which the leading role, role of Nizami Ganjavi, was played by Muslim Magomayev. The Nizami Mausoleum, built in honor of Nizami, stands just outside the city of Ganja in Azerbaijan. It is a tall cylindrical building, surrounded by gardens. To one side, there is a metal statue commemorating Nizami's epic poems. The mausoleum was originally built in 1947 in place of an old collapsed mausoleum and rebuilt in its present form when the Azerbaijani Republic regained its independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Monuments to Nezami are found in many cities of Republic of Azerbaijan and Iran, as well as in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Udmurtiya (Russia), Kyiv (Ukraine), Beijing (China), Tashkent (Uzbekistan), Marneuli (Georgia), Chişinău (Moldova), Rome (Italy). 2021 was declared as \"Year of Nizami Ganjavi\" in the country.

Even today the national passion for poetry is constantly expressed over radio and television, in teahouses, in literary societies, in daily conversation, and in the Musha'areh, the poetry recitation contest. Nizami's work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituallity and genuine piety. For richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled\". Nezami's story of Layla and Majnun also provided the namesake for a hit single by Eric Clapton, also called \"Layla\". Recorded with the group Derek and the Dominos, the song was released on the 1970 album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. The album was influenced by Nezami and his poetry of unrequited love.

A \"pioneer in the application of modular seating,” many of his ideas have been adopted by other designers. Early life and education Harvey Probber was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1922. While attending Samuel J. Tilden High School, he took a part-time job in a used-furniture store, and was inspired to try his hand at drawing ideas for furniture. Probber sold his first sofa design when he was just 16, for $10. After high school graduation, he accepted a job as designer for Trade Upholstery, a small manufacturing facility on West 17th Street. 1940 was the beginning of American modernism, a time characterized by young designers with talent, initiative, and a willingness to take risks with new ideas. Probber was one of an early band of pioneers in a field that included D.J. DePree of Herman Miller, Hans Knoll, Georg Tanier and Jack Lenor Larsen. Design career and Harvey Probber, Inc. Probber established Harvey Probber, Inc., in 1945 and in the middle years of the twentieth century, Harvey Probber became one of America's leading designers. Though he considered himself a modern designer, his approach to modernity favored exotic woods, highly polished lacquer, hand-rubbed finishes and opulent upholstery fabrics—materials largely abandoned by more radical, Bauhaus-influenced designers. Probber's designs, like those of Edward Wormley, Tommi Parzinger, were sought after by customers who wanted modern furniture with elegance. In 1947, when showroom space wasn't available in Chicago’s Merchandise Mart, he took his line to Grand Rapids, then the center of the furniture manufacturing industry. In 1948, seeing the potential in the interior design market he opened a showroom at 136 Fifth Avenue, catering exclusively to designers. In little over a decade, Harvey Probber, Inc. became one of the country’s leading contemporary furniture firms. His elastic sling chair and Nuclear upholstered groups were chosen for MoMA’s Good Design exhibition in 1951, and he won several prestigious Roscoe industry awards. Modular seating Probber’s most significant design breakthrough came when he was exploring approaches to seating furniture and found that, “the key to salvation was in bits and pieces of plane geometry… they were meaningless alone, but when fused to conventional shapes, profoundly altered their character.” These “bits and pieces” became templates for the line he named the Sert Group (after architect Jose Luis Sert). It consisted of nineteen different elements that could be assembled into any desired seating configuration. Probber referred to the concept as a modular system, and the individual pieces as modules. Although what was then called “unit furniture” dates to the first decades of the twentieth century, Probber's modular seating was the first of its kind. Taking the concept further, he introduced “nuclear furniture”—which included occasional tables with interchangeable pedestals, in different shapes and sizes that could, like seating, be clustered in varying configurations. In the 1960s, he extended the idea to case goods, making it possible",

During this period, Probber's work was awarded two \"Best of Neocon\" Gold Awards from the Resources Council of the Institute of Business Designers for the Houston Chair (1977) and the Advent III Customization Program (1981). He never abandoned his interest in seating modules, however, and continued to explore variations of the concept.

Sister publications eventually included Overseas Family and Overseas Traveler, as well as a Pacific edition during the height of the Vietnam War.

By focusing on stories too racy for the official military daily, Stars and Stripes, OW had a circulation of 15,000 by 1953, when the military establishment banned it from base newsstands on the grounds of \"sensationalism\" and denied its use of the printing and circulation facilities of Stars and Stripes. PRospach enlisted the help of California Sen. William F. Knowland and filed suit against the Secretary of Defense, Charles Erwin Wilson, actions that succeeded in lifting the ban and increasing its profile. Rospach rented offices in the Frankfurt Press Club, contracted with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung to print the newspaper and hired a staff of German and expatriate civilians and former U.S. military men, with the Americans paid a starting salary of $60 a week, later raised to $70. An early hire was a German-born ex-serviceman, John Dornberg, who became the paper's news editor and later a correspondent for Newsweek and author of books and articles about Germany and Eastern Europe. Life magazine took note of the newspaper about this time, describing Rospach as \"a stubby dynamo of a woman\" and OW as \"the bane of the U.S. armed forces command in Germany.\" \"The OW was a tabloid whose front page featured a partially clad young woman and two or more enticing headlines--sometimes printed in red ink--on the lines of \"LT SEDUCED MY WIFE, GENIUS GI TELLS COURT.\" Courts-martial, generally not covered by the Stars and Stripes, was a news staple, along with more pin-up photos, the comic strip Beetle Bailey and an editorial bias that favored enlisted men over their officers. To the military it was known as the \"Oversexed Weekly\". In 1958 Rospach added a second weekly, the Overseas Family, edited by Cecil Neff and more genteel in content, to appeal to the wives and children of military personnel. In 1961 an OW reporter broke the story of the \"pro-Blue\" program sponsored by Maj. Gen. Edwin Walker, commander of the U.S. Army's 24th Infantry Division in Augsburg. In a front-page story, the newspaper accused Walker of brainwashing soldiers with right-wing materials from the John Birch Society In return, Walker condemned the OW as \"immoral, unscrupulous, corrupt and destructive.\" Relieved of his command and passed over for promotion, Walker resigned from the U.S. Army that October. Curtis Daniell, a recently discharged serviceman, became the OW executive editor in 1963, when the newspaper reached a weekly circulation of about 50,000. As the Vietnam War began to intensify, Daniell hoped to publish a Pacific edition but was refused space on military newsstands in South Vietnam. Nevertheless, in 1966 he sent reporter Ann Bryan to Saigon to establish a bureau there, and in time she won permission to publish a Pacific edition of the OW, printed in Hong Kong and flown to Saigon each week.

Animal Man In Animal Man #25 (July 1990), Grant Morrison reintroduces Limbo, a dimension inhabited by old characters seemingly abandoned or forgotten by their publishers. The comic depicted such characters as the Inferior Five, Mr. Freeze, and the Gay Ghost (who expressed a desire not to be revived). This comic was published in the wake of DC's Crisis on Infinite Earths, in which many historic comics were removed from continuity. This \"comic book limbo\" is a metafiction, based on the notion that any character who has not been published recently can be said to reside in \"comic book limbo\". Final Crisis Limbo reappeared decades later in Final Crisis: Superman Beyond, also by Morrison, as the world on the edge of the multiverse past the Graveyard Universe of Earth-51. Merryman of the Inferior Five was still resident, and described himself as the \"King of Limbo\". In Superman Beyond, Limbo is shown to contain \"the Library of Limbo\", with only one book in it.

Like the entire island it belongs to the district of Nordfriesland. Wyk includes the two minor town districts of Boldixum and Südstrand. Geography Wyk is situated on the southeastern edge of the island. About 4,500 inhabitants live there, but during the tourist seasons 20,000 or more people will stay there. It serves as a regional centre for the islands of Föhr and Amrum, providing shopping centres, doctors, a post office, etc. and it is the seat of the Amt Föhr-Amrum and the social care centre for the islands. The approximately 4,200 other inhabitants of Föhr proper live in other villages on the island. Wyk's major source of income is the tourism business. History and tourism In 1704, Wyk was granted the rights of a seaport, two years later, the rights of a market town were awarded. In 1819 a seaside spa was established, being the first of its kind in Schleswig-Holstein. Thereby the state began to level up with the Baltic Sea region (Heiligendamm, 1794 and the East Frisian North Sea area (Norderney, 1794). In the first year, 61 guests were recorded, in 1820 there were 102, but only from 1840 on the numbers exceeded 200. From 1842 to 1847 the Danish king Christian VIII chose Wyk as his summer resort, which attracted numerous new tourists. In 1844 Hans Christian Andersen followed his king to Wyk and is known to have said about Wyk's beach: \"I bathed every day and I must say it was the most remarkable water I have ever been in\". But Andersen also criticized the problems of journeying there. For example, from Hamburg, on the road, a traveller needed four days to reach Föhr, by ship via Heligoland, it took two days only but included the danger of sickness. In 1910 Wyk was granted full town rights. Wyk's promenade Sandwall does not only offer a view on the sea, but also a view on the Halligen, already beloved by king Christian. It is counted among Germany's most beautiful seaside promenades. Not at least due to the high number of sanitoriums and recovery institutions, Wyk is a highly frequented spa throughout the year.

Traffic Wyk is the only harbour of Föhr, providing a ferry port, a fisheries and freight port and a marina. From the ferry port, several sailings per day are scheduled to the mainland port of Dagebüll while other ferries depart in the opposite direction towards the island of Amrum. Most ferries to Dagebüll have a train connection from there to Hamburg via Niebüll. The ferries are operated by Wyker Dampfschiffsreederei Föhr-Amrum GmbH whose seat is in Wyk.

It was also known as the Center for Russian and East European Jewry in the latter 1970s and the 1980s. Birnbaum's father and grandfather were recognized authorities on East European Jewry. He had extensive experience in assisting survivors of Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism after World War II, and later mobilized British students to assist distressed Jews of North Africa. A citizen of the UK, he arrived in New York City in the latter part of 1963 where he noted increasing expressions of public concern for the plight of Soviet Jews but encountered only one grassroots activist, Morris Brafman, who had just put together a small group, soon to be known as the American League for Russian Jews, in Brooklyn's Mill Basin area. (At the time Birnbaum did not hear of a 1962 one-time Matzoh demonstration by a small group of Yeshiva University High School students led by Columbia University student Bernard Kabak.) By January 1964 he was settled in Washington Heights near Yeshiva University where he began to",

In the same month, he persuaded Bernard Kaplan, the Social Action Chairman of the national student organization Yavneh to set up a Soviet Jewry committee and by April he was ready to go national and issued a Manifesto titled \"College Students Struggle for Soviet Jewry\" convening a founding meeting at Columbia University for April 27, 1964. His use of the term \"struggle\" was ironically designed as a spinoff of the Marxist term \"class struggle.\" The New York Times wrote in Birnbaum's 2014 obituary: \"Mr. Birnbaum insisted that every rally include posters declaring 'Let my people go,' the line from Exodus 9:1 that became the clarion call of the movement.\" Initial activism After the Eichmann trial in 1961 (witnessed by Birnbaum in Jerusalem) people had become increasingly aware of the horrors of the Holocaust, so the Columbia meeting proved emotional and there was a call for action. Birnbaum proposed a protest rally outside the Soviet UN Mission on the Soviet May Day holiday, only 4 days later. He mobilized his Yeshiva University core, contacted other campuses, and some 1,000 students showed up, getting excellent media publicity. According to the Center for Jewish History, this May Day rally marked the commencement of public confrontation with the Kremlin and the initiation of the national movement for Soviet Jewry. Thereafter, four other Soviet Jewry pioneers, Dr. Moshe Decter, Professor Abraham Joshua Heschel, Israeli diplomat Dr. Meir Rosenne, and Dr. Louis Rosenblum of Cleveland (later founding Chairman of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews), were delighted to support Birnbaum's initiatives. Ten days later, Birnbaum formed SSSJ's first steering committee and initiated a series of groundbreaking public events which in the course of two years resulted in a surge of public consciousness which pushed the hesitant U.S. Jewish establishment from a policy of quiet diplomacy toward a more activist mode. In 1964, this commenced with the dispatch of information kits to student summer camps nationally in May, a week-long interfaith fast in June, and a massive rally in October with the participation of President Lyndon Johnson's representative Mayer Feldman, New York Senators Jacob Javits and Kenneth Keating, and Mayor John Lindsay on the Lower East Side, the original area of East European Jewish settlement. One unique characteristic of Birnbaum's mobilization of public opinion was to draw on ancient Jewish redemptive themes — for example, the intensification of activities around Passover time, with its themes of liberation and exodus. SSSJ's first student button portrayed a shofar with the wording \"Save Soviet Jewry.\" The years 1964–1966 served as the early \"Shofar period\" of the Soviet Jewry movement – a call to conscience and a call to action. Infrastructure In 1965 Birnbaum led SSSJ in a challenge to the wall of separation cutting off Soviet Jewry. He organized two Jericho Marches around Soviet diplomatic buildings in New York (April) and Washington, DC (May) to the accompaniment of the sounds of the shofar. The walls did not tumble down but the media understood the symbolism. At the April event, Rabbi Shlomo",

Nineteen months of intense street activity plus the distribution of much educational material resulted in a breakthrough, stirring a number of Jewish establishment organizations to greater activism, and they joined SSSJ's great Redemption (Geulah) March of Passover 1966 with a record turnout of some 12,000 people. The Exodus March of Passover 1970 drew some 20,000, as did a Madison Square Garden Hanukkah event in 1971. From 1964 to 1971, SSSJ was the only American organization engaged in a full-time campaign for Soviet Jewry, independently raising its meager funding from the grassroots without official assistance. Though from the beginning Birnbaum directed SSSJ on a strictly responsible non-violent policy of moderate activism, \"along the lines of aggressive civil rights organizations like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee,\" the Jewish establishment was intensely hostile. Birnbaum was able to attract a number of sympathizers in the Establishment, including major figures such as Rabbi Herschel Schacter, former Chairman of the Conference of Presidents, the late Rabbi Israel Miller, the late Richard Maass and the late Stanley Lowell, first and second chairmen of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, Dr. Norman Lamm, later President of Yeshiva University. In the academic world, his founding supporters included: Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, Chairman; Dr. Irving Greenberg, Vice Chairman; and Rabbi Charles Sheer, Vice Chairman. Rabbi Avraham Weiss became an officer in 1971, accelerated SSSJ’s activist modes, and campaigned relentlessly for Anatoly Sharansky. Succeeding Rabbi Riskin as chairman, he served in that capacity 1984–1989. Founding students included Sandy Frucher, Hillel Goldberg, Arthur Green, Dennis Prager, Glenn Richter, Benjamin Silverberg, James Torczyner, and Sanford Zwickler. After some years, Richter gave up his law studies and joined Birnbaum full-time to become National Coordinator in which capacity he served until January 1990. Originally Birnbaum's fastest typist, he assumed the bulk of SSSJ's administrative routines, and became well known for his small \"rapid response\" demonstrations, his informative press releases, and together with Allan Miller, the compilation of massive lists of prisoners of conscience and refuseniks. American (National) Conference on Soviet Jewry The official American Conference on Soviet Jewry, was established in April 1964 as a followup to a meeting convened in October 1963 by Moshe Decter, \"a writer who championed Soviet Jews.\" The meeting included Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The group was renamed National Conference on Soviet Jewry in 1971. This group, however, barely functioned without an allocated budget or permanent staff till the Leningrad trial of December 1970 finally shocked the Jewish leadership into the establishment in September 1971 of two officially funded groups — the National Coalition Supporting Soviet Jewry and the Greater New York Conference on Soviet Jewry.

Malcolm Hoenlein, a Birnbaum disciple, was the founding director of the Greater New York Conference and initiated in 1972 the Solidarity Sunday marches and rallies modeled on SSSJ's 1960s events. By the 1980s, these great annual public events in New York drew attendances of over 100,000. Economic pressure on the Kremlin in the 1970s In the 1970s and 1980s, Birnbaum shifted his attention to new policy initiatives. In the early 1970s, SSSJ concentrated on the utilization of economic pressures on the Kremlin. He had in fact testified in Congress on this concept as early as May 1965, was in close contact with Senator Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson's office regarding the Jackson-Vanik Amendment signed into law almost ten years later in January 1975. Pressure was applied by President Reagan on the Soviet Union's Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Coverage by the New York Times (and presence of important government officials) for smaller scale marches and demonstrations also forwarded a message. Birnbaum testified in Congress some eighteen times between 1976 and 1986 in relation to the Amendment's application to emigration from Romania and achieved the release of six long-time prisoners, a rescue which elicited an enthusiastic letter of congratulations from the State Department. \"\" (their heritage): Defense of Jewish self-education groups in the 1980s During the 1980s, Birnbaum deepened SSSJ's support of a Jewish awakening in the USSR. After 1917, the Soviets had destroyed all aspects of Jewish communal, religious, cultural, and social life, resulting in a severely weakened sense of Jewish identity among Soviet Jews. The rise of a \"Let My People Go\" resistance movement was accompanied by the development of an underground Jewish renaissance movement, in the form of religious, cultural, and Hebrew language self-education groups. To publicize this, Birnbaum added the words \"Let My People Know\" (their heritage) to SSSJ's original \"Let My People Go\" slogan and marshaled the support of various Christian groups in annual spring campaigns in the early 1980s for the protection of these self-education groups under intense attack by the KGB. In September 1985, he organized and led a mixed delegation of Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform rabbis under the auspices of the inter-denominational Synagogue Council of America to meet with the Deputy Secretary of State. In Montreal SSSJ was started by Robert Weisz and Abie Ingber, based in the Hillel student organization and gained wide support from community organizations. Montreal and Canadian Jewry took a leading role internationally in the struggle to free Soviet Jews. Support of Post-Soviet Central Asian Jewish communities in the 1990s In the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet empire, Birnbaum became involved in the defense of Jewish communities in the Central Asian republics which had been part of the USSR.

King also earned nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director and the Critics Choice Award for Best Director. Plot In 1963, Cassius Clay nearly loses a boxing match to Henry Cooper at Wembley Stadium in London. At the Copacabana in New York City, soul singer Sam Cooke suffers through a performance in front of a cold, all-white audience. Returning home to Georgia, NFL player Jim Brown is received by family friend Mr. Carlton on a vast plantation. Carlton ladles praise on \"the great Jim Brown,\" but when Brown offers to help Carlton move some furniture, Carlton uses a racial slur and informs Brown that he is not welcome inside the home due to Brown's blackness. Elsewhere, Malcolm X returns home and discusses his plans to leave the Nation of Islam with his wife, Betty. On February 25, 1964, the men are all in Miami for Clay's title bout against Sonny Liston. Malcolm meets with Clay in a hotel room before the fight, and the two pray in a traditional Islamic fashion. That night, Brown is a ringside commentator and Cooke and Malcolm X are in the crowd as Clay upsets Liston, making him the world heavyweight champion. Afterward, Malcolm invites the other three men to his motel room. Their hopes of a party are dashed when Malcolm makes it clear they are the only ones he invited. He wants to spend some time reflecting on their accomplishments, but tension between him and Cooke arises. Malcolm accuses Cooke of disloyalty to the black community by pandering to white audiences, and Cooke argues that his method produces greater economic empowerment for black artists. Clay informs the men of his plans to announce his conversion to the Nation of Islam, causing more tension. Brown discusses his plans to become a film actor, and wonders if it will go smoothly. The conflict between Malcolm and Cooke escalates. Malcolm harshly ridicules the music Cooke has produced since finding success. Cooke insists his success and creative autonomy is itself an inspiration to the black community, and while he still cares about the black struggle in America, protest songs are not commercially viable. Malcolm confronts him with the success of Bob Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\". As they argue, it becomes clear that Malcolm's antagonism of Cooke is motivated, at least in part, by the activist's stress over his own life, especially his harassment by the FBI and fears about",

A knock at the door informs them that the press has gotten wind of the meeting. As Clay prepares to talk to the media, he asks Malcolm to come with him. When they leave, Cooke tells Brown that he has had similar thoughts about \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and has already written a song, but not yet performed it. In the aftermath of the night, Clay officially changes his name to Muhammad Ali, while Malcolm's life is thrown into chaos as he suffers the consequences of his split with the Nation of Islam; his house is firebombed, but he completes his autobiography.

There was a unique Early Medieval tradition in Ireland and Britain of raising large sculpted stone crosses, usually outdoors. These probably developed from earlier traditions using wood, perhaps with metalwork attachments, and earlier pagan Celtic memorial stones; the Pictish stones of Scotland may also have influenced the form. The earliest surviving examples seem to come from the territory of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, which had been converted to Christianity by Irish missionaries; it remains unclear whether the form first developed in Ireland or Britain. Their relief decoration is a mixture of religious figures and sections of decoration such as knotwork, interlace and in Britain vine-scrolls, all in the styles also found in insular art in other media such as illuminated manuscripts and metalwork.

The earlier crosses were typically up to about two metres or eight feet high, but in Ireland examples up to three times higher appear later, retaining thick massive proportions, giving large surface areas for carving. The tallest of the Irish crosses is the so-called Tall Cross at Monasterboice, County Louth. It stands at seven metres or twenty-two feet high. Anglo-Saxon examples mostly remained slender in comparison, but could be large; except in earlier Northumbrian examples their decoration is mostly ornamental rather than figures. The crosses often, though not always, feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a Celtic cross; this seems to be an innovation of Celtic Christianity, perhaps at Iona. Although the earliest example of this form has been found on fifth-seventh century Coptic textile. The term \"high cross\" is mainly used in Ireland and Scotland, but the tradition across Britain and Ireland is essentially a single phenomenon, though there are certainly strong regional variations. Some crosses were erected just outside churches and monasteries; others at sites that may have marked boundaries or crossroads, or preceded churches. Whether they were used as \"preaching crosses\" at early dates is unclear, and many crosses have been moved to their present locations. They do not seem to have been used as grave-markers in the early medieval period. In the 19th century Celtic Revival Celtic crosses, with decoration in a form of insular style, became very popular as gravestones and memorials, and are now found in many parts of the world. Unlike the Irish originals, the decoration usually does not include figures. Ireland and Britain High crosses are the primary surviving monumental works of Insular art, and the largest number in Britain survive from areas that remained under Celtic Christianity until relatively late. No examples, or traces, of the putative earlier forms in wood or with metal attachments have survived; the decorative repertoire of early crosses certainly borrows from that of metalwork, but the same is true of Insular illuminated manuscripts. Saint Adomnán, Abbot of Iona who died in 704, mentions similar free standing ringed wooden crosses, later replaced by stone versions.<ref>The Archaeology of late Celtic Britain and Ireland, c. 400–1200 AD, Lloyd Robert Laing, p. 169</ref> Perhaps the earliest surviving free-standing stone crosses are at Carndonagh, Donegal, which appear to be erected by missionaries from Iona. fleeing the Viking raiders, \"giving Iona a critical role in the formation of ringed crosses\". The round bosses seen on early crosses probably derive from Pictish stones. High crosses may exist from the 7th century in Northumbria, which then included much of south-east Scotland, and Ireland, though Irish dates are being moved later. However the dates assigned to most of the early crosses surviving in good condition, whether at Ruthwell and Bewcastle, the Western Ossory group in Ireland, Iona or the Kildalton Cross on Islay, have all shown a tendency to converge on the period around or slightly before 800, despite the differences between the Northumbrian and Celtic types.

Most Irish High crosses have the distinctive shape of the ringed Celtic cross, and they are generally larger and more massive, and feature more figural decoration than those elsewhere. They have probably more often survived as well; most recorded crosses in Britain were destroyed or damaged by iconoclasm after the Reformation, and typically only sections of the shaft remain. The ring initially served to strengthen the head and the arms of the high cross, but it soon became a decorative feature as well. The high crosses were status symbols, either for a monastery or for a sponsor or patron, and possibly preaching crosses, and may have had other functions. Some have inscriptions recording the donor who commissioned them, like Muiredach's High Cross and the Bewcastle Cross. The earliest 8th- or 9th-century Irish crosses had only ornament, including interlace and round bosses, but from the 9th and 10th century, figurative images appear, sometimes just a figure of Christ crucified in the centre, but in the largest 10th century examples large numbers of figures over much of the surface. Some late Irish examples have fewer figures (often Christ accompanied by a local bishop or abbot), approaching life-size, and carved in very high relief. The Irish tradition largely died out after the 12th century, until the 19th-century Celtic Revival, when the Celtic cross form saw a lasting revival for gravestones and memorials, usually just using ornamental decoration and inscriptions. These are now found across the world, often in contexts without any specific link to the Insular Celts or Britain. Anglo-Saxon crosses were typically more slender, and often nearly square in section, though when, as with the Ruthwell Cross and Bewcastle Cross, they were geographically close to areas of the Celtic Church, they seem to have been larger, perhaps to meet local expectations, and the two 9th century Mercian Sandbach Crosses are the largest up to that period from anywhere. The heads tend to be smaller and usually not Celtic crosses, although the majority of cross-heads have not survived at all. Carved figures in these large examples are much larger and carved in deeper relief than the Irish equivalents with similar dates – only some very late Irish crosses show equally large figures. Anglo-Saxon decoration often combines panels of vine-leaf scrolls with others of interlace, although the placement and effect from a distance is similar to Celtic examples. Smaller examples may have only had such decoration, and inscriptions, which are much more common on Anglo-Saxon than Irish crosses. After the Viking invasions, the settled Norse population of the Danelaw adopted the form, and a number of crosses combine Christian imagery with pagan Norse myths, which the Church seems to have tolerated, and adopted at least as metaphors for the period when conversion was bedding down.

        "prompt": "crosses were the bulk of the production in England, as the high cross seems to have been abandoned further south, although the simple and practical Dartmoor crosses, no doubt an essential aid to navigating Dartmoor, appear to have continued to be made for centuries after. Given the tough granite used, decoration is mostly slight and they are hard to date confidently. Market crosses, many once dating to the Early Medieval period, have continued to be erected and replaced until modern times. In Pictish Scotland the cross-slab, a flat stone with a cross in relief or incised on an essentially rectangular stone, developed as a hybrid form of the Pictish stone and the high cross. The cross is normally only on one side of the stone and the remaining areas of the stone may be covered with interlace or other decoration. These are usually distinguished from true high crosses. Scandinavia The tradition of raising high crosses appeared at a time when Norse settlers appeared in the British Isles and met a Christian culture. A fragmentary cross has been discovered in Granhammar in Vintrosa parish in Närke, Sweden and testify to the English mission in the central Swedish provinces. The Swedish cross was very similar to a cross in Leek, Staffordshire, and may have been made by an English immigrant. In Norway the British tradition was more widely accepted and some 60 stone crosses are known from the country, but only four of them can be safely dated to the Viking Age thanks to runic inscriptions on the crosses. Many of the crosses have probably been raised on pagan grave fields when the family was baptised. Later, they were moved to cemeteries. The high cross tradition also probably helped increase the popularity of raising runestones (often with engraved crosses) in Sweden. Notable examples Amongst the most famous are: Muiredach's Cross and West Cross at Monasterboice, County Louth The Clonmacnoise crosses: Cross of the Scriptures (the original 9th century cross is housed in a museum, but a copy stands on the original site), and the North and South Crosses. The Nether (or Lower) Cross, a 9th-century granite cross with ornate carving, in the graveyard of St. Canice's Church, established by St. Canice, Finglas village, Dublin. The Cross was taken from its original location in the grounds of St. Canice's Abbey and buried to prevent damage by Cromwellian forces in 1649. It was found 160 years later intact and moved to its present location. The Anglo-Saxon Ruthwell Cross from Scotland, 8th century, with relatively large figures.

It is highly decorated and 5.33 m. high Modern period From the 19th century, many large modern versions have been erected for various functions, and smaller Celtic crosses have become popular for individual grave monuments, usually featuring only abstract ornament, usually interlace. In 1887, the Rev. William Slater Calverley commissioned a replica life-sized copy of Gosforth cross and had it erected in the churchyard at Aspatria, Cumbria.[3] In the early 21st century, Irish sculptor Brendan McGloin was commissioned by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Portland to handcraft a full size replica of the Clonmacnoise Cross of the Scriptures. The 13-foot, 5 tonne sandstone cross was completed in 2007 and shipped from Donegal to Portland, Oregon, where it will stand as a Famine memorial. In 2016, a high cross was erected outside Wakefield Cathedral, West Yorkshire, England, carved from stone quarried in Holmfirth and carved by Celia Kilner.

Arthur ran the firm successfully, but suffered a bad shock from a breach of verbal trust with a major supplier, and he soon died, to be replaced as head of the firm by his 21-year-old son, the future novelist Gilbert Frankau. Family and business background Based initially in London's Whitechapel, by the mid-1840s Joseph Frankau had successfully established himself as an importer of leeches and cigars, trading as J. Frankau & Co. Meanwhile, Joseph's younger brothers Nathan and Adolph Frankau had emigrated from Germany to the U.S.A. where they set up a dry goods business. Nathan Frankau remained in the U.S., establishing himself successfully as an importer and retailer of fancy goods, first in New Haven CT and later in New York NY: \"Every piece of merchandise in his shop was bought by him because he thought it was fine.\" Adolph left New Haven for London (England), and started a business (Adolph Frankau & Co.) which later became known as a leading supplier of briar pipes such as the BBB brand. Their younger brothers Sidney and Henry Frankau also came to London, Sidney trading in partnership with Adolph in the early 1850s before starting his own firm (Sidney Frankau & Co.), again importing pipes and fancy goods.

Arthur Frankau, born at 22 Great Alie Street in February 1849, was to be the last of Joseph's children whose birth was registered in the Whitechapel District: his younger sister Alice was born in Islington in 1852, and younger brother Edwin in Hampstead in 1854. In the mid-1850s, Joseph and Adolph Frankau and their families, and Sidney Frankau, all resided in Hampstead. Arthur Frankau and his generation were cousins of New York actor Joseph Frankau, who was one of Nathan Frankau's children. Arthur Frankau at J. Frankau & Co. J. Frankau & Co., with its head office at 30 Gracechurch Street (London EC), was to remain a family business for three-quarters of a century. Arthur Frankau's eldest sister Delia married the firm's managing clerk Joseph Grunbaum in 1868. Arthur's cousin Frances Frankau, eldest daughter of his uncle Henry Frankau, was to marry managing clerk E. H. Musgrave in 1883, by which time Arthur Frankau and Joseph Grunbaum were partners in the firm, along with Arthur's younger brother Edwin Frankau. Arthur Frankau too married in 1883. His bride was Julia Davis, daughter of portrait photographer Hyman Davis, and later to become well known in her own right as author Frank Danby. They lived first at 103 Gloucester Terrace (London W), where their eldest son Gilbert Frankau was born in 1884, before moving to 32a Weymouth Street in the later 1880s. There, their two younger sons, Paul (known as Jack) and Ronald Frankau, were born in 1890 and 1894 respectively, as was their daughter Aline (1896–1986), known as Joan. American costume designer Aline Bernstein recalled staying at Arthur and Julia Frankau's house when her father, the New York actor Joseph Frankau (who was Frankau's first cousin) was performing in London: \"It was a perfect Georgian house, everything in it had beauty and order; the design of the furniture, the chintz, the arrangement of flowers, the way food was passed at table, and the tea service. It was brilliantly clean, the silver and old woods looked as though they not only had just been polished, but had been polished for hundreds of years.\" She also remembered that Arthur and Julia's children \"all lived upstairs like a separate little family, almost like a lot of little lepers, it seemed to me.\" In 1903, the death of Edwin Frankau and the success of Frank Danby's latest novel, Pigs in Clover, provided Arthur and Julia Frankau with the means to move house once more, to 11 Clarges Street (Mayfair), and to acquire a holiday home on the Sussex coast named Clover Cottage (now No. 13 South Cliff, Eastbourne). \"But my father had no zest for the Mayfair game,\" recalled his son Gilbert. Arthur Frankau \"was very much the model of the self-denying, hard-working, family-oriented, successful Jewish businessman of popular legend.\" \"I naturally came to know Arthur Frankau well,\" recalled his wife's friend and fellow-writer Marie Belloc Lowndes. \"He had the cultivated, reserved manner which in those days was common in a",

But this unwritten agreement was broken by the Upmanns in 1901: \"If ever one man’s lies shortened another man’s life, they were Heinrich Upmann’s lies to my father,\" wrote Gilbert Frankau. \"The shock of learning that his trusted associates had no conception of business honour turned his iron-grey hair nearly white. He was a sick man – with his only surviving partner, his brother-in-law Joseph Grunbaum (\"Uncle G.\"), now a widower, verging on seventy. In imagination, he saw the business ruined. 'What a bloomer,’ he used to say. 'My God, what a bloomer. I backed the wrong horse.'\" Death and disaster Arthur Frankau died at Clover Cottage, Eastbourne, on 21 November 1904 from galloping consumption apparently contracted on a business trip to Havana. \"When he died, it was found that he had left his wife everything he possessed – including his great business – in a one-line will.\" His widow Julia commissioned a substantial memorial from the celebrated sculptor and goldsmith Alfred Gilbert, at an agreed price of six hundred guineas; substantial amounts of money changed hands, but no monument was ever forthcoming from Alfred Gilbert, and 1906 saw Julia Frankau and her sister Eliza (the gossip columnist \"Mrs Aria\") whipping up a considerable media campaign against him. The Frankau family memorial eventually erected in Hampstead Cemetery is in every sense a monumental piece of Art-Deco, Grade II listed by English Heritage in 1999 and possibly the work of Julia and Eliza's brother-in-law, London architect Marcus Collins (who was married to their eldest sister Florette). J. Frankau & Co. became a Limited Company in 1905, Arthur's eldest son Gilbert (just 21 years of age) taking the position of Managing Director, but with his brother-in-law Joseph Grunbaum (\"Uncle G.\") and cousin Fritz Frankau on the Board in a supervisory capacity. Within a few years Joseph Grunbaum died and Gilbert Frankau invested heavily in a cigarette-making concern, W. Sandorides & Co., to launch a new cigarette brand, Lucana. The profits of J. Frankau & Co. were swallowed up by Gilbert's loss-making Lucana cigarette venture, prompting Fritz Frankau to resign from the Board. At the beginning of 1914, Gilbert Frankau successfully renegotiated – in a written agreement – the family firm's sole U.K. agency for Upmann cigars which Arthur Frankau had been so horrified to lose in 1901, but war was shortly to supervene in August 1914, and both J. Frankau & Co. and W. Sandorides & Co. were sold following Julia Frankau's death in March 1916. Fritz Frankau would remain a Director of his own late father's firm, Adolph Frankau & Co., until April 1924, whereupon the Frankau family's business involvement in the tobacco trade finally ceased, nearly ninety years after Arthur Frankau's father first arrived in East London.

He served as an editor for two popular entomology periodicals of his period, The Entomologist's Annual and The Entomologist's Weekly Intelligencer. Biography Stainton was the son of Henry Stainton, belonging to a wealthy family in Lewisham. After being privately tutored, he went to King's College London. He was the author of A Manual of British Butterflies and Moths (1857–59) and with the German entomologist Philipp Christoph Zeller, a Swiss, Heinrich Frey and another Englishman, John William Douglas of The Natural History of the Tineina (1855–73). He undertook editing William Buckler's and John Hellins' work, following their deaths: The Larvae of the British Butterflies and Moths. He was also a prolific editor of entomological periodicals, including the Entomologist's Weekly Intelligencer (1856–61) and the Entomologist's Monthly Magazine (1864 until his death – the magazine continues to be published). Stainton was a very wealthy man and his house in Lewisham, \"Mountsfield\", was one of London's more substantial residences set in its own park. Other wealthy entomologists often stayed at Mountsfield when visiting London, notably Alexander Henry Haliday and Deiterich Carl August Dohrn. The zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors was a close friend. Such people, sought by the growing number of scientific societies, wielded enormous influence on scientific development. Stainton was a regular visitor to both Haliday's house in Lucca and to Dohrn's in Stettin. He was a member of both the Entomological Society of London and the Stettin Entomological Society.

The bridge was moved from its original location, , northeast of Carroll on Bish Road NW, to its current location spanning Fetters Run. It is a single-span wood and steel combination truss bridge. The bridge was documented by the Historic American Engineering Record as John Bright No. 2 Covered Bridge in 1986. Bridge No. 1 The John Bright No. 1 Iron Bridge, near Carroll, Ohio, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It was built by the Hocking Valley Bridge Works and is a single-span steel eye-bar bridge. According to the Historic American Engineering Record: The John Bright No. 1 Iron Bridge was built by the Hocking Valley Bridge Works (HVBW) of Lancaster, Ohio, probably in 1884-5. It is one of a relatively small number of surviving bridges to have been built by this local firm. The suspension truss design is very unusual, and is only known to have been used in a few bridges in Ohio by three bridge builders. There are some similarities in this bridge to several patented designs, but it most closely resembles Archibald McGuffie's 1861 patent for 'Improvement in Construction of Bridges.' The bridge is very similar in design to the nearby John Bright No. 2 Covered Bridge (see HAER No. OH-45). The bridge was built to span Poplar Creek, carrying Havensport Road NW over Poplar Creek, about northeast of Carroll, at . It now spans Fetters Run, at . It was moved to its current position downstream of John Bright Bridge No 2, on Fetter's Creek, in 1986.

Italian people – living in the Italic peninsula or abroad – have been throughout history the source of important inventions and innovations in the fields of writing, calendar, mechanical and civil engineering, musical notation, celestial observation, perspective, warfare, long distance communication, storage and production of energy, modern medicine, polymerization and information technology. Italians also contributed in theorizing civil law, scientific method (particularly in the fields of physics and astronomy), double-entry bookkeeping, mathematical algebra and analysis, classical and celestial mechanics. Often, things discovered for the first time are also called inventions and in many cases, there is no clear line between the two. The following is a list of inventions, innovations or discoveries known or generally recognized to be Italian.

He pioneered galvanoplastic experiments, introducing the technique of electroplating. His acquaintance with A. Volta played an important role in his scientific career. He hypothesized that in the chemical pile there was also a transport of atoms, obtaining experimental evidence of this. He discovered the properties of coal cathodes as electrical conductors and succeeded in covering them with a metallic layer. He sensed the possible applications in the industrial field, sharing this procedure with a Pavese goldsmith, who used it. Encyclopedia: from the Greek enkýklios paidèia, meaning a set of doctrines constituting a complete education. The comprehensive works of Aristotle can be considered encyclopedic (covering politics, rhetoric, ethic, aesthetic, psychology, biology, math).

These encyclopedias, along with the works of Cassiodorus and Boethius, paved the way for the medieval seven liberal arts. Epidemiology (innovated): Roman scholar Marcus Varro mentioned microorganisms as a possible causal agent of diseases. Girolamo Fracastoro, in the mid 16th century, was the first one to scientifically state the real nature of germs, infection, and contagious ways of disease transmission. He attributed the causes of diseases to very small living particles, invisible to the eye. They were considered vulnerable to fire, capable of self multiplying as well as spreading by air. Espresso machine first prototype invented by Angelo Moriondo in 1884 in Turin. (piston driven model) invented by Achille Gaggia in 1945. Estimo: discipline, part of economic science, which establishes the logical and methodological principles allowing a reasoned, objective and generally valid formulation of the esteem of the monetary value of economic goods. The first estimative surveys of a normative character took shape with the Italian Catasti a Valore (translated, land-value registers), called Estimi a Apprezzi. Florentine estimate method was already codified in the thirteenth century. From the sixteenth century the land, merchant and then civil esteems of the capital began to spread in Italy. The first modern treaty on Estimo was Trattato della stima dei Beni Stabili by Cosimo Trinci, who introduced the concept of ascending and descending influences on the capitalization rate according to the different land's characteristics.

Microscope: Sometimes credited as the first compound microscope, Galileo Galilei found after 1610 that he could close focus his telescope, maybe even turning it around backwards, to view near by small objects. This method was combersom since he had to extend his 2 foot long telescope out to 6 feet to view objects that close. After seeing a purpose built compound microscope by Drebbel exhibited in Rome in 1624, Galileo built his own improved version. Giovanni Faber coined the name microscope for the compound microscope Galileo submitted to the Accademia dei Lincei in 1625 (Galileo had called it the \"occhiolino\" or \"little eye\"). Microscopic anatomy and histology, pioneered by Marcello Malpighi in the 1660s. Mile, a unit of distance based on the distance covered in 1,000 steps by a Roman legionnaire.

(Petroleum internal-combustion) motorcycle: in 1884 Enrico Bernardi built the first vehicle in the world powered by a petrol engine, a tricycle called Motrice Pia; Karl Friedrich Benz developed a similar metallic motor tricycle in the following year (1885). A motorcycle is a two- or three-wheeled motor vehicle. Firsts known petroleum motorcycles are the Daimler Reitwagen with 2 wheels plus 2 outriggers (1885), and the Butler Petrol Cycle with 3 wheels plus 2 castors (1887). In 1893 Bernardi mounted a petrol engine on a propulsion wheel for an ordinary bicycle, thus, according to what Enrico Fermi wrote for the Treccani Encyclopedia, creating the first motorcycle. Bernardi is to be considered one of the pioneers of the automobile too. He partnered with the Miari e Giusti to produce three- and four-wheeled automobiles powered by the gasoline engine he had invented and patented in 1882. The Bernardi mod 3,5 HP (1896) features many of his innovations, such as geometrically correct steering, cylinder with detachable head, overhead valves and a centrifugal inlet valve regulator. The quality of the vehicles was demonstrated by travelling for 60000 km without engine failure. Motorways, as a controlled access highway that directly connects two cities: Autostrada Milano-Varese in 1924. Moving Picture Experts Group Standard.

School (partially innovated): at the height of the Roman Republic (and later during the Empire) parents were expected to have their children alphabetized and educated (albeit with partial gender discrimination on the specific subjects), especially in order to enter a political career. Formal schools were established and arranged in progressive and meritocratic tiers. In the words of Quintilian, a teacher in the 1st century AD: \"Some boys are lazy, unless forced to work; others do not like being controlled; some will respond to fear but others are paralyzed by it. Give me a boy who is encouraged by praise, delighted by success and ready to weep over failure.\" The rigorous educational method and curriculum used in Rome was copied in its provinces, providing a basis for education systems throughout later Western civilization.Michael Chiappetta, \"Historiography and Roman Education,\" History of Education Journal 4, no. 4 (1953): 149-156.

Roman Senate: a deliberative assembly of the Romans, lasting from the 8th century BC to at least the 7th century AD. The term senate comes from the Latin senatus or \"Assembly of Elders\". Previous councils of elders are known in Greece and in the Greek cities of Hellenistic and Roman ages; there was also a similar organism in Carthage. Rome established the senate as one of the fundamental institutions of the state and, for a long time, the main responsible for both domestic and foreign policy. Until the 15th century, the magistracy of the (roman) senator appointed by the Pope, along with magistrates of popular nomination (i.e. tribunes, reformers, conservatories), retained real authority, lasting with a symbolic role until the 19th century.

Stock Exchange (origins): the underlying principles of stock exchange were introduced by Italian merchants in Bruges (Belgium); an early example of stock exchange dates back to around 1309 in an inn called \"Huis ter Beurze\". The inn belonged to the Ter Bourse family, merchants of possible (if not likely) Venetian origin (della Borsa), who conducted transactions at the inn. The term 'beurs' derives from the name of this inn, spreading to other European countries and evolving into 'bourse', 'borsa', 'bolsa', 'börse', etc. In England the term ‘bourse’ was used between 1550 and 1775, eventually giving way to the term ‘royal exchange'. T Modern enclosed Theater. Their structure was similar to that of ancient theaters, with a cavea and an architectural scenery, representing a city street.

Tarot: Tarot, any of a set of cards used in tarot games and in fortune-telling. Tarot decks were invented in Italy in the 1430s by adding to the existing four-suited pack a fifth suit of 21 specially illustrated cards called trionfi (“triumphs”) and an odd card called il matto (“the fool”). Tarot card reading: One of the earliest reference to tarot triumphs is given c. 1450–1470 by a Dominican preacher in a sermon against dice, playing cards and 'triumphs'. References to the tarot as a social plague continue throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, but there are no indications that the cards were used for anything but games anywhere. As philosopher and tarot historian Sir Michael Dummett noted, \"it was only in the 1780s, when the practice of fortune-telling with regular playing cards had been well established for at least two decades, that anyone began to use the tarot pack for cartomancy.\" Tontine, a form of life insurance developed by Lorenzo De Tonti in 1653.

Typewriter - in 1575 the venetian printer and bookseller Francesco Rampazetto created the first prototype of a machine that could impress letters on a piece of paper by means of \"tactile writing\". In 1714 the English engineer Henry Mill patented a typewriter without fabricating it. Early versions of the typewriter are reported in Austria in 1779 and Italy just after 1800 by Pellegrino Turri and Pietro Conti di Cilavegna. In 1855 Novara lawyer Giuseppe Ravizza built and patented the Cembalo scrivano or macchina da scrivere a tasti (lit. \"key based typing machine\"), modeling its keyboard design on the keys of pianoforte. The Cembalo Scrivano is recognized as the most advanced typing machine until the invention of Remington. Cembalo scrivano was also capable of printing upper and lower cases that didn't exist yet in the first Remington typewriter machine.electronic typewriter: Olivetti ET 101 is the first Olivetti e. t.

U Unibody of Lancia Lambda, a car designed by Vincenzo Lancia and presented between 1921-'22. The vehicle introduced the fusion between chassis and bodywork, halving the weight compared to similar displacement cars and providing much higher resistance to impact in respect to traditional structures. Other new features included independent front suspension, allowing better safety, and a V-shaped overhead four cylinder engine. University: the term comes from the Latin \"universus\", meaning \"the whole / the universe\", indicating a community of masters and scholars focused on higher learning concerning all - both secular and religious - human knowledge known to that date, namely Jurisprudence, Medicine, Philosophy and Theology. European academics attending the universities were expected to have already mastered the seven liberal arts, spanning from grammar to music and astronomy. The University of Bologna (founded around 1088 AD) is, by these standards, the first university of the world and, as its motto goes, 'Nourishing Mother of the Studies'. Many other universities started flourishing in Italy from the 13th century onward. Previous higher educational institutions existed during the Islamic Golden Age (the first one being the University of Karueein in 859 AD), focusing mainly on Islam (religion and laws) and only later obtaining the status of Universities. European universities themselves have, in part, religious origins, rooted in medieval Christian monastic schools and other institutions teaching theology. Finally, academies developed well before the Roman empire, with the most famous being depicted almost two millenniums later by Raphael: the school of Athens. Medieval universities are distinguished from the academies of the classical age by the particular legal recognition (i.e. degree) they granted to those who completed the studies.

The most peculiar feature of Venice's celebration has laid in the extensive use of masks. The rite of Carneval has obscure origins, possibly Roman. Vespa: in 1946 the Italian vehicle manufacturer Piaggio patented a \"motorcycle of a rational complexity of organs and elements combined with a frame with mudguards and a casing covering the whole mechanical part\". This design became one of the most popular scooters worldwide and is still in production. The Vespa had an inedited load-bearing bodywork.

Viola (partially innovated): slightly larger than violin, is characterized by lower and deeper sound. Known fabrication started in northern Italy between 1530 and 1550. It is speculated that the 'Viola da gamba' was invented in Valencia, Spain, to be later introduced in Italy during Renaissance: a valencian painting representing a viola dates back to 1475. However, the viola is the oldest arched instrument, dating back, in different forms, to at least the 9th century. Ascribing the true origin of this instrument to specific geographical locations leads to questionable results. W Watermark: this medieval innovation was first introduced in Fabriano, Italy, in 1282. Welfare: the earliest form of welfare was the lex frumentaria instituted by the tribune Gaius Gracchus dating back to 122 B.C., a law that ordered Rome's government to supply its citizens with allotments of cheaply priced grain. Galileo Hydrostatic Weighing Scale, a weight measuring device that uses hydraulic counter-force of a liquid, usually water or oil, to determine weight of an object under Archimedes' principle.

Black reaction: a silver staining technique which was first performed by Camillo Golgi. It helped the study of the nerve cells. Blood circulation: since Galen times it was believed that the internal human body circulation was separated in two different circuits: veins system, carrying food to the body, and arteries system, responsible for the flowing pneuma or \"circulating air\" in the body that was necessary to vital functions. Although many beliefs of Galen have been disproved by many Italian anatomists during Renaissance, the first who guessed blood did not mix in the heart and, instead, formed a single circulating system passing through the lungs, was the Spanish physician Miguel Serveto. However, his works were largely unknown for a long time as he was burned at the stake with his books for heresy by order of the city's governing council of Geneva, and it was an Italian anatomy professor, Realdo Colombo, who validated the intuitions of Servetus, proving that cardiac septum is impermeable to blood. He also spoke correctly about the existence of pulmonary circulation. Girolamo Fabrizi d’Acquapendente (1537-1619) was the first to study the valves of the veins, but it was Andrea Cesalpino the one who described the circulation of blood in the body. Cesalpino showed that the heart, not the liver, is the engine that physically pumps the blood into the vessels: starting from the arteries to capillaries, blood reaches the whole body, then it returns through the veins up to the heart. He used for the first time the term blood circulation and he demonstrated that in veins and arteries flows only blood, not pneuma, and that the passage of blood from arteries to veins through capillaries is due to difference of pressure. It remains famous his experiment of ligature of veins then resumed by William Harvey in order to prove the blood flow course in veins. Finally, Marcello Malpighi gave with his microscope observational proof of the exchange of blood from arteries to veins in capillaries. Cerebrospinal fluid: the physician Domenico Cotugno is credited with the discovery of this fluid in 1774.

He was the first to describe a condom (in his writings, a linen sheath wrapped around the penis), and he advocated the use of such sheaths to prevent syphilis. Germ theory of disease (as a scientific theory): physician Girolamo Fracastoro, scholar and poet, in 1546 was the first proposing that epidemic diseases are caused by transferable tiny particles or \"spores\" that could transmit infection by direct or indirect contact or even without contact over long distances. In his idea the \"spores\" of diseases may refer to either chemicals or living entities. He appears to have first used the Latin word fomes, meaning tinder, in the sense of infectious agent. He was the one to christen the syphilis disease with this name, from the name of a young boy Syphilius in Greek mythology, who was punished with an horrible disease for he had offended Apollo. Fracastoro also gave the first scientific description of typhus. The lunar crater Fracastorius is named after him.

Trotula: Trota De Ruggiero (or Trocta) was a medical practitioner, probably a regular physician and university Professor who lived in the early 12th century in Salerno, near Naples. It seems she was daughter of one of the private Professors of the Schola Medica Salernitana, following her father's steps as a physician and teacher of medicine, and whose progeny continued this tradition as well. It is uncertain whether she was the first woman of the Medieval age to become a graduated physician in the Western World, but it is well known from various sources that at least 24 women practiced surgery in Neapolitan Area during Middle Ages. Trota left a collection of writings about the cure of women illnesses in a codex named after her, Trotula. It consists of three manuscripts, of which only the book called De curis mulierum (lit. \"On Treatments for Women\") is attributed to her, while the other two are works of different authors.

Colony, from the Latin \"colonia\", indicating a Roman outpost established to secure conquered territory (sometimes situated near previous settlements) and built for retired Roman legionaries. Colonies have been part of a Roman policy \"whose wisdom only the future could fully reveal\"-(Cedric A. Yeo, The Classical World). Eventually the term denoted the highest status of a Roman city. Many colonies survived the fall of Rome, with some becoming seminal European cities (e.g. London, Paris, Barcelona, Frankfurt). The map of Roman infrastructures manifests a remarkable pattern similarity with European road density today: ancient cities and roads might have set the template for the next two thousand years of economic development. Cosmology of Giordano Bruno: he expanded the relatively new Copernican theory proposing for the first time the idea that the stars were distant suns (as bodies emitting energy) surrounded by their own planets (as bodies receiving and reflecting energy) orbiting around. According to Steven Soter \"[this] is arguably the greatest idea in the history of astronomy\". Giordano raised the possibility that these planets might foster life of their own, a philosophical position known as cosmic pluralism; he also claimed the universe is infinite and could have no \"center\". Barely suffering any form of religious authority, he was excommunicated by three different Christian cults: Catholics, Lutherans and Calvinists. In his positions Bruno identified God as a God-Nature, as a reality that in itself subsists immanent in the guise of the Infinite, since infinity is the fundamental characteristic of the divine. For this reason and other beliefs considered heretic by the Catholic Church, such as negating Holy Trinity, he was dragged into court in Venice by local Inquisition, where he skillfully tried to defend himself stating that philosophers in their course of thoughts, according to \"the natural light of intellect\", can come to conflicting conclusions with the matters of faith, without having to be considered heretics. Roman Inquisition asked for his extradition to Rome, that was exceptionally granted by the Venetian Senate, and in Rome Bruno decided to not defend himself anymore and instead openly declare his beliefs. Found guilty of heresy, he was burned at the stake.

Fascism: illiberal political movement characterized as a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism, created by politician and then dictator Benito Mussolini. Futurism: an artistic and social movement born in Italy in the early 20th century, that glorified modernity, emphasized speed, technology, youth, impetuosity, and iconic objects of modernity and speed such as internal combustion engines, the car and the airplane as a form of art, an ideal of beauty and trendy absolute ambition for manly boldness. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti was the most prominent figure of the movement. Humanism: a broad concept present in different cultures, derives its term from the Latin \"humanitas\", developed during Roman times (see Aulus Gellius). Latin alphabet, derived from the Greek alphabet; became the foundation of many languages worldwide, e.g. Neo-Latin languages. Currently more than 4.9 billion people rely on this alphabet. Machiavellianism: term denoting the political philosophy of Machiavelli, especially regarding his most famous work, Il Principe, or The Prince. The book advocated realpolitik and a consequentialist approach to political action, recommending rulers to be ready to act in deceitful ways, such as resorting to fraud, treachery and elimination of political opponents, and to use fear as a means of controlling subjects, in order to retain a ruler's power and security in the state. Renaissance humanism: a cultural movement of rebirth in the study of classical antiquity, originating in Italy and then spreading across Western Europe (around 1300–1500). Humanists perceived themselves as a different kind of men opposed to those who lived in medieval age and who had another vision of the world, science and literature, rougher and incomplete if compared to the humanistic rediscovery of ancient classics, new perception of nature of things, and a new way of conceiving arts and beauty.

The seminal distinction between laws of property and obligation has characterized all Western Civilization. Historically, Democritus justified private property because it was efficient. Aristotle added the argument of human nature. Etruscans and Romans perceived private property as the bond of the family with the ancestors and gods. Runic alphabet: the runic alphabet was based on Old Italic script. Sonnet: type of poetry originating in Italy and highly developed by Francesco Petrarca. Scholasticism (as a philosophy): a school of thought that employed a critical method of analysis and tried to reconcile the Christian faith with a system of rational thought (mainly derived from Greek philosophy), integrating classical philosophy as anticipating Christian theology. The intent of the scholastics was to develop a harmonious knowledge, integrating the Christian revelation with the philosophical systems of the Greek-Hellenistic world, as they were convinced of their compatibility, and to seek in the knowledge of the classics (mainly from great thinkers such as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus) a route able to raise the acceptance of Catholic dogmas. Scholasticism started developing from the works of the Roman Boethius at the very onset of the Middle Ages. (as a method of organizing studies): an organization of higher education present in ancient schools and universities. Clergymen and secular literates usually started their cursus studiorum in capitular schools enclosed by abbeys and monasteries, learning the arts of Trivium (grammar, logic and rhetoric) and then proceeding in the arts of Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). King Lothair I of Italy, nephew of emperor Charlemagne, created a system of high schools in strategic cities of his reign (Pavia, Ivrea, Turin, Cremona, Florence, Fermo, Verona, Vicenza, Forlì) in order to train skilled officials and bureaucrats. Italian merchant cities enhanced the schooling system by creating, around 1100, the \"Scuole d'Abaco\" (abacus learning schools) as professional institutes intended for the preparation of accountants, clerks, and any sort of trading specialists.

At the very end of the 17th century, the Italian Giovanni G. Saccheri resumed the concept of Khayyam–Saccheri quadrilateral in order to prove the fifth postulate, ultimately in vain. However, Saccheri became, quite unintentionally, discoverer and forerunner of non-euclidean geometries. In his demonstrative effort, he came to the description of the various properties of hyperbolic lines, subdividing the straight lines into three distinct classes: incident, asymptotic and ultraparallel. Furthermore, he outlined the fundamental concept of angle of parallelism. Later, fathers of hyperbolic geometry were Gauss, Janos Bolyai, and Lobachevsky. Scientific method (consisting of observation through quantification, hypothesis and testings of models): was theorized by Galileo Galilei, recognized as 'the father of modern science, physics and astronomy'. Galilei wanted to reach whatever conclusions a scrupulous and methodical analysis of evidence suggests rather than seeking exclusively the aspects of reality confirming and conforming to a specific orthodoxy. Galileo's method and discoveries represented the focal point for the European scientific revolution in the 17th century. He invalidated a belief system that parted the ancient world from modernity. Galileo revolutionized the goal of science: to research the mathematical properties of substances, such as 'location, motion, shape, size, opacity, mutability, generation and dissolution', instead of their intrinsic essence. Galilean relativity (the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame): this seminal principle, defined by Galileo, was perfected and expanded during the following centuries. For example, Einstein's theory of special relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in any inertial frame, and, in particular, any measurement of the speed of light in any inertial frame will always be constant (around 300000 km/s). Law of inertia: a body having constant (k=0 v k>0) velocity, will retain its vector unless a force (f>0) acts upon it. Defined by Galileo for horizontal motion. Uniformly accelerated motion: correctly described for falling bodies from height h using an inclined plane by Galilei in d (distance) = k (constant)*t 2 (or d ∝ t 2) , v (velocity) ∝ t , v ∝ h1/2, with the specific mass of the bodies being irrelevant. Previously, William Heytesbury described the earliest mathematical relationship of motion with constant acceleration; with Nicole Oresme and Giovanni di Casali providing graphical demonstration of Heytesbury's statement. Isochronism of the pendulum: Galileo proposed this principle and illustrated a mechanical clock using the pendulum, with C. Huygens formulating the isochronism properly and credited as inventor of the pendulum clock. Controversy sparkled between Vincenzo Viviani and Huygens about the paternity of the invention. Italian school of algebraic geometry: being formed between 1891 and 1912, especially thanks to Corrado Segre, the school grouped several brilliant students and academics. C.

Indian Brahmagupta had already solved 2nd degree equations. Ballistics: the discipline of ballistics was initially studied and developed by Italian mathematician Niccolo Tartaglia Ruffini's rule: a practical method developed by Paolo Ruffini allowing the factorization of polynomials (without degree limitation) as products of binomials, provided they meet particular conditions defined by the Ruffini's theorem. Mathematical analysis: Evangelista Torricelli's work in geometry and Cavalieri's principle, using the method of indivisibles and infinitesimals, paved the way for integral calculus (e.g. Bonaventura Cavalieri solved ), which was later predominantly developed by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. This method allowed the two Italian mathematicians to obtain simply and rapidly the area and volume of several geometric figures, including solids of revolution. Torricelli expanded Cavalieri's method to include curved indivisibles: the improvement consisted in the confrontation between two planar figures broken down using, respectively, rectilinear indivisibles for one and curved indivisibles (i.e. curves of infinitesimal thickness) for the other. If each curved indivisible has the same extension of the associated rectilinear indivisible then the areas of the two figures are equal. More dramatically, studying the curve describing distance as a function of time, Torricelli understood the concept of instant velocity as the tangent of a point on the curve forming an angle with the x axis.https://amslaurea.unibo.it/13819/1/GiorgiaLari.pdf Lari, Giorgia (2016) \"Storia del calcolo differenziale e la disputa tra Leibniz e Newton, Tesi di Laurea in Storia della Matematica\" \" Translation from source There are two origins of the derivative: geometrical (the tangent problem), with Descartes and Fermat, and mechanics (the determination of the velocity of a varied motion), with Galileo, Torricelli and Barrow.\" He intuited derivatives and, implicitly, the inverse character of integration and derivation. The fundamental theorem of calculus was explicitly enunciated by Isaac Barrow (thus called T.-Barrow theorem). Barrow himself mentioned Galileo, Cavalieri, and Torricelli. Eventually, the theorem received formal demonstration by Isaac Newton. Torricelli's trumpet: E.Torricelli researched the apparently contradicting properties (at least for his time) of a solid of revolution with finite volume (calculated by Torricelli to be π/a, with a value of abscissa) and yet infinite surface, obtained when the curve y=1/x for x=1 v x>1 is rotated in 3-space about the x-axis. In recognition for his works on infinitesimal geometry he was referred to as 'the highest geometer', in the century when Descartes, Cavalieri, Fermat and Huygens lived too. He",

He introduced the curved indivisibles, that is the integration by substitution and the use of curvilinear coordinates, and, along with Fermat, worked towards the generalization of the Cavalieri's quadrature formula (solving the case of higher hyperbolae). Among other things, Torricelli calculated the volume of solids formed by any lateral surface and limited by two plane surfaces (e.g.: the volume of barrels). He also solved the Torricelli–Fermat point, worked with Roberval on the cycloid (its quadrature, center of gravity, and rotational solid), and researched the ballistic trajectories. Logarithmic spiral: was conceived and graphically rectified by Torricelli, up to its center, to which the curve tends after infinite revolutions. Torricelli substituted the \"potential infinite and infinitesimal\" of the Greeks with the \"actual infinite and infinitesimal\". Fano resonance: discovered by Italian physicist Ettore Majorana, and named after Italian-American Ugo Fano, who produced a theoretical explanation of the phenomenon. U. Fano is also known for Feshbach–Fano partitioning, Fano factor, Fano noise, Lu–Fano plot, Fano effect, Fano–Lichten mechanism, Beutler-Fano profile and Fano's theorem. Fubini's theorem: a result defining the conditions under which is possible to calculate a double integral by using iterated integral, described by Guido Fubini. He is also known for developing the Fubini-Study metrics in 1904, with Eduard Study describing the same just one year later, in 1905. Fubini opened new paths in the areas of analysis, geometry and mathematical physics. Functional analysis: Vito Volterra is considered founder of this branch of mathematics. He developed a general theory of functionals, i.e. functions of functions, not to be confused with function composition, and his works are credited with having a generous influence on modern calculus (e.g. harmonic integrals). Volterra also applied his analytics to the theories of elasticity, distortion and electromagnetism. He independently co-developed the predator-prey model. Peano axioms, defining the arithmetical properties for the set of natural numbers N; these postulates were proposed by Giuseppe Peano, a founder of mathematical logic and set theory. He wrote Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita; common mathematical symbols have been introduced by or are derived from his work, such as ∈, ⊂, ∩, ∪, and A−B. He is also known for having developed the Peano curve, the Peano existence theorem, the Peano-Jordan measure, the Peano kernel theorem, the Peano–Russell notation and the Peano form of the remainder for the Taylor's theorem. His contributions spanned from geometry, mathematical analysis and vector calculus to logic and the indagation of principles. Probability calculus: initiated in Europe by Italian mathematicians, statistics and probability met general and systematic theorization with Pascal and Fermat. Cardano, for instance, enunciated what is possibly the first definition of classical probability. Permutation and combination had already been used by Arab mathematicians. Tensor calculus: extension of vector calculus to tensor fields, allowing expression of physics equations in a form that is independent of the choice of coordinates on a manifold, such as space-time.

Classical and celestial mechanics: Giuseppe Luigi Lagrangia improved the Newtonian mechanics formulating what is known as Lagrangian mechanics, introducing the concepts of generalized coordinates, potential (i.e. gravitational or electrical field) and Lagrangian orbits. Group theory: Lagrange's theorem of groups (a subgroup's order must always divide the order of the group exactly) represents one of the earliest steps in the theory of groups. Lagrange is considered a founder of group theory, along with Niels Henrik Abel and Évariste Galois. Hydrodynamics Winds (in scientific terms): explained by Torricelli as an atmospheric phenomenon consisting of movements of air masses \"produced by differences of air temperature, and hence density, between two regions of the earth\". He wrote \"we live submerged at the bottom of an ocean of air\". Torricelli also described fluids with the Torricelli's law, a particular case of Bernoulli's principle; his work was so important that Ernst Mach considered T. \"founder of hydrodynamics\". Venturi effect: fluid pressure is reduced when a fluid flows in a more constricted section of a pipe. Discovered by the Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Venturi. Avogadro principle: equal volumes of all (ideal) gases, at the same temperature and pressure, have the same number of particles (atoms or molecules). Law of Capacitance: Q (quantity of charge) = C (capacitance) * V (tension or voltage), discovered by Alessandro Volta (its proper formulation is: Q ∝ V). Mercalli scale, developed by volcanologist Giuseppe Mercalli, classifies the intensity of an earthquake based on its visible effects on buildings. Metallurgy (innovated): Pirotechnia by Vannoccio Biringuccio (1540) represents the first book (and the first printed) totally dedicated to metallurgy, elements and techniques. V. Biringuccio is regarded as \"the first true foundryman and the father of the foundry industry\". Prior to his publication, foundry techniques were kept as a secret and generally handed down orally: Pirotechnia is the starting point for a true technological literature, interested in experimental fact and method, of which Biringuccio is considered an important exponent (also see Bernardino Telesio and Francis Bacon). Milky Way (in scientific terms): Galileo observed, described and theorized our galaxy as a collection of a tremendous amount of stars. Paleontology: although mainly known for his artistic endeavors, Leonardo da Vinci was paleontology's founding father (also see Science of Leonardo da Vinci, about Leonardo's visionary research). Paleoceanography, Cesare Emiliani is considered founder of this field of science, having discovered that deep oceans are not immutable environments: they have oscillated considerably in temperature over geological ages. CKM Matrix: a unitary matrix containing information about the strength of the flavour-changing weak interaction. The first version of the matrix was developed in 1963 by Nicola Cabibbo -renowned physicist and later president of the Pontifical Academy of Science- and was subsequently completed by the Japanese Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa. Nobel Prize was awarded to the latter two omitting the former. Cabibbo's work helped in understanding the violation of an almost exact symmetry of charge and parity between particles and the corresponding antiparticles, called Cp violation. It",

Quantum loop theory: the Italian theoretical physicist and writer Carlo Rovelli is one of the founders of this quantum theory of gravity, together with Lee Smolin and Abhay Ashtekar. The theory is aimed at merging the general relativity with quantum mechanics. Furthermore, C. Rovelli and French mathematician Alain Connes put forward the thermal time hypothesis in order to solve the problem of time. Relational quantum mechanics: interpretation of the state of a quantum system as the relation between the observer and the system, introduced by C. Rovelli. Viterbi algorithm, developed by the Italian-American Andrea Viterbi, found useful applications in mobile phones. Gini Index: often used in economy and statistics to define, among the units of a community, the global measure of the inequality in income's distribution. Least absolute deviations: a statistical technique introduced by Serbian-Italian, Croatian and European scientist Ruggero Giuseppe Boscovich. His physical theories would influence Hamilton. Particles Astatine (co-discovered, in US): Dale R. Corson, Kenneth Ross MacKenzie, and Emilio Segrè are credited with isolating the element in 1940. Methane, the simplest hydrocarbon, isolated and studied for its inflammable properties by Alessandro Volta. He also demonstrated interests in the ignition of other inflammable gases through electric sparks, designing a rudimentary electric pistol. Technetium (Tc): in 1937 two Italian scientists - Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segrè - produced technetium-97, the first artificial element. Segrè and Glenn T. Seaborg later isolated the metastable isotope Tc-99m that, having just a 6-hour half-life, found useful applications in medical radiographic scanning. Antiproton: co-discovered in a 1955 by Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain, both awarded with Nobel Prize. They brought experimental evidence of the existence of the proton's antiparticle. W and Z bosons (collaboration in discovery): discovered by Cern's UA1 and UA2. In 1976 Carlo Rubbia, Peter McIntyre and David Cline suggested the creation of the CERN's proton-antiproton collider. C. Rubbia led a team of physicists in the UA1 Collaboration, managing the construction of the central detector, which allowed to obtain experimental evidence of the bosons in 1982-'83; in November 1982 the first W candidate was found; the discovery was reported during a workshop in Rome the following year (12-14 January) and then internationally. Simon van der Meer contribution has been vital for stocking large quantities of anti-protons. Both S. Meer and C. Rubbia have been awarded with the Nobel prize. Astronomy Ceres: father Giuseppe Piazzi was the first to discover an asteroid he called Ceres, the major object in the Asteroid belt of the Solar system, and considered a dwarf planet by modern astronomic terminology. He cataloged 7,646 stars, demonstrating that most stars are in relative motion to the Sun. He also discovered the proper motion of the double star 61 Cygni. The asteroid 1000 Piazzia and a Moon's crater have been christened with his name. Jupiter moons, discovered in 1610 and named by Galileo Galilei thanks to his enhanced telescope.

Lagrangian orbits: mathematician and astronomer Giuseppe Luigi Lagrangia, also known as Joseph Louis Lagrange, was one of the creators of the calculus of variations and discovered the points of libration in a planetary orbit, now called Lagrangian Points, by studying the astronomic and mathematic problem of calculating the evolution during time of three celestial bodies (such as Sun, Earth and Moon) concurrent orbits. Moon's mountains and valleys, observed by Galileo. These observations led to a radical change from obsolete Aristotelian theories (considering the celestial realm unchanging and eternal). Meteor shower's origin, demonstrated by Giovanni Schiaparelli to be the remnants of comets. He also conducted studies on double stars, Mercury, Venus, and Mars (describing its canals). Saturn rings, planar rings of icy particles orbiting Saturn; they were first spotted by Galileo, although their true nature has been unveiled only later. Tethys, Dione, Rhea and Iapetus, four of the main moons of Saturn, were discovered by G. Cassini. Sun spots, dark spots on the surface of the Sun visibly contrasting with the surrounding region, discovered by Galile Military innovations Strategies, methods and operations Fabian strategy, a delaying strategy (similar to guerrilla-warfare) first implemented by Quintus Fabius Maximus \"Cunctator\" in 217 BC. Italian fencing style: towards the end of '500, the Italian style, putting an emphasis on skills and speed instead of force, spread across Europe, with fencing being instituted as an art. Italians used a lighter weapon, the rapier, finely balanced and fabulous for attack, together with a style of fencing that was, at the same time, simple, controlled and agile. Italians discovered that using the point of the sword was more effective than relying on its edge. The early English fencing style was substituted by the continental one. Beretta: founded around 1526 by Bartolomeo Beretta, the Fabbrica d’Armi Pietro Beretta is the world's oldest manufacturing company and can be considered the oldest industry; during the Venetian-Turkish war (1570–73) Beretta produced 300 weapons per-day. According to Marco Morin and Robert Held, well-known experts in military history, in the 16th century the Brescian valley became \"an envied supplier of weapons on a global scale, which for the unsurpassed quality and strength of its products and above all of its gun barrels beat the great metallurgical centers of the time like Suhl, Augsburg and Nuremberg, in Germany\": weapons were purchased by different Italian States, France and England. In 1975, Beretta introduced the 9mm Model 92, which met worldwide diffusion as the self loading pistol most adopted by armies and law enforcement. Troops Frogmen: the first modern frogmen were the World War II Italian commando frogmen.

The Italian example was soon followed by other countries having mountainous areas and thus France formed the Chasseurs des Alpes, in Germany the Alpenkorps were born, in Austro-Hungarian Empire the Landwehr and the Tyrolean hunters (Kaiserjäger); similar troops appeared in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Switzerland and Spain. During WWI the Alps have been the major theater of mountain warfare (also called Alpine warfare). Music Notation and performance Modern music notation, theorized by Guido di Arezzo in his work Micrologus de disciplina artis musicae (1026). Guidonian solmization, assigning each note of the diatonic scale to a Solfège (or sol-fa) syllable. This represents a practical method for teaching sight-singing (singing music from written notation). Guido di Arezzo chose the syllables from the first syllable in each line of the Latin hymn Ut queant laxis (Hymn to John the Baptist): ut (or do), re, mi, fa, sol, la, si''' (subsequent convention). Ballet, invented and performed for the first time in Florence during the Italian Renaissance. Bel canto, a style that reigned supreme in Italian theaters, concert halls, and churches throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Cantata, (from Italian cantare, sing), originally designating a musical composition meant to be sung as opposed to be instrumentally performed (viz., sonata); now vaguely used for compositions featuring both voices and instruments. The early \"cantata\" have been written by Italians, and this word was used for the first time by the Italian composer Alessandro Grandi; there had been precursors (such as strophic arias, and late madrigals of Claudio Monteverdi). Libretto, grouping opera text; the earliest operas had their words printed in small books (lit. libretto) for commemoration (see also melodramma). Opera, the earliest (1597) being written by Ottavio Rinuccini, put to music by Jacopo Peri and titled 'Dafne (also see Neapolitan genre Opera Buffa). Oratorio, large musical composition for orchestra, choir and soloists, usually narrative and sacred in nature; the first surviving being Rappresentazione di anima et di corpo (lit. The Representation of Soul and Body) by Emilio del Cavaliere, characterized by dramatic action and ballet. Later, Giacomo Carissimi's o. verged towards a more sober expression, adopting Old Testament text written in Latin. Symphony (origins): symphonies are written, usually orchestral, instrumental compositions. Their starting point can be located in Lombardy around 1730; in specific, they are to be found in Alessandro Scarlatti's opera overtures, showing a fast-slow-fast structure (Allegro-Adagio-Allegro) that later spread throughout Europe. A second type of symphony, bipartite slow-fast, emerged from the compositions of Italian-French Giovanni Battista Lulli. However, the etymology of the word is συμφωνία (\"agreement or concord of sound\"), and the concept existed at least since the mid-16th century. Early orchestral compositions have been written by Giovanni Gabrieli, with the vivid Italian style being prosecuted by his pupil Heinrich Schütz.
